          <p class="flush-left">As the birthplace of Mao Zedong, Communist Party cadres might wax lyrical about the sacred standing of Húnán (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">湖南</span></span>) in the annals of Chinese history, but it's Húnán’s dramatic scenery that is the real draw.</p>
          <p class="body-text">A magnificent landscape of isolated mountain ranges and jagged, karst peaks envelops more than 80% of the province. The most astonishing example is found at the phantasmagorical Zhāngjiājiè, one of China's most surreal national parks. Here, as in other parts of the province, geological marvels thrust up majestically from green vales fed by tributaries in the fertile Yangzi River basin.</p>
          <p class="body-text">People have long made a home amid Húnán's natural wonders, taming the rocky slopes into terraces of lush fields, and their distinctive cultures live on in charming villages and towns, the most alluring being the historic riverside settlement of Fènghuáng.</p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Húnán was one of the empire’s granaries, transporting vast quantities of rice to the embattled north. By the 19th century, land shortages and feudalism caused widespread unrest among farmers and hill-dwelling minorities. These economic disparities galvanised the Taiping Rebellion in the 1850s, ensuring widespread support by the 1920s for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Húnán’s Mao Zedong.</p>

In the 1920s it was still so well preserved that British philosopher Bertrand Russell is said to have compared it to a medieval town, but not long after, the Sino-Japanese War and a massive fire in 1938 gave Chángshā (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">长沙</span></span>) an irreversible facelift, leaving little of its early history. These days it's a modern, energetic city, known mainly for sights relating to Mao Zedong, but with its magnolia-lined streets and riverine aspect, it's a pleasant enough stopover and provincial capital.</p>

A reflective 32-year-old Mao immortalised it in <em>'</em>Changsha'<em>,</em> probably his best regarded poem, after standing at its southern tip and looking west towards Yuèlù Mountain one autumn day. A towering granite bust of a youthful Chairman with flowing locks now stands at the spot – but faces in a new direction.</p>

The lovely lobby is great for sitting down with a coffee or beer, and there's a backyard with table tennis and a pool table. Travel notices pinned up around the place are in Chinese only, but some staff speak a little English and are happy to help out.</p>
            
            
              <p class="body-text">The location is pleasant – tucked away down a quiet, tree-lined residential street – but out of the way. Take bus 136 from the train station and get off at Xiàdàlǒng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">下大垅</span></span>) bus stop. Cross the road, walk along the alley called Dongfeng Ercun Xiang (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">东风二村巷</span></span>), which is opposite the bus stop, and you'll find Gongshang Xiang behind the shops, running parallel to the main road. From Xiàdàlǒng bus stop, buses 112 and 901 go to Jiefang Xilu.</p>

The swarms of young and old drop something to the tune of ¥1.8 billion annually in Sháoshān (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">韶山</span></span>). Mao statues alone are such big business that each must pass inspection by no fewer than five experts checking for features, expression, hairstyle, costume and posture. The 6m-high bronze statue of Mao erected in 1993 in Mao Zedong Sq is considered a model example.</p>

          <h3>MAO: THE GREAT HELMSMAN</h3>
          
            <p class="box-flush-left">Mao Zedong was born in the village of Sháoshān in 1893, the son of ‘wealthy’ peasants. Mao worked beside his father on the 8-hectare family farm from age six and was married by 14.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">At 16, he convinced his father to let him attend middle school in Chángshā. In the city, Mao discovered Sun Yatsen’s revolutionary secret society. When the Qing dynasty collapsed that year, Mao joined the republican army but soon quit, thinking the revolution was over.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">At the Húnán County No 1 Teachers’ Training School, Mao began following the Soviet socialism movement. He put an ad in a Chángshā newspaper ‘inviting young men interested in patriotic work to contact me’, and among those who responded were Liu Shaoqi, who would become president of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and Xiao Chen, who would be a founding member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">Mao graduated in 1918 and went to work as an assistant librarian at Peking University, where he befriended more future major CCP figures. By the time he returned to teach in Chángshā, Mao was active in communist politics. Unlike orthodox Marxists, Mao saw peasants as the lifeblood of the revolution. The CCP was formed in today's Xīntiāndì area in Shànghǎi in 1921, and soon included unions of peasants, workers and students.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">In April 1927, following Kuomintang leader Chiang Kaishek’s attack on communists, Mao was tasked with organising what became the ‘Autumn Harvest Uprising’. Mao’s army scaled Jǐnggāng Shān, on the border with Jiāngxī province, to embark on a guerrilla war. The campaign continued until the Long March in October 1934, a 9600km retreat that ended up in Yán'ān in north Shǎnxī province. Mao emerged from the Long March as the CCP leader.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">Mao forged a fragile alliance with the Kuomintang to expel the Japanese, and from 1936 to 1948 the two sides engaged in betrayals, conducting a civil war simultaneously with WWII. Mao’s troops eventually won, and the PRC was established on 1 October 1949.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">As chairman of the PRC, Mao embarked on radical campaigns to repair his war-ravaged country. In the mid-1950s he began to implement peasant-based and decentralised socialist developments. The outcome was the ill-fated Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s and the chaos of the Cultural Revolution (1966–76).</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">China saw significant gains in education, women’s rights and average life expectancy under Mao’s rule; however, by most estimates, between 40 and 70 million people died during that era of change, mainly from famine. Five years after Mao’s death, Deng Xiaoping famously announced Mao had been 70% right and 30% wrong in an effort, some say, to tear down Mao’s cult of personality. Yet today, Mao remains revered as the man who united the country, and he is still commonly referred to as the ‘Great Leader’, ‘Great Teacher’ and ‘supremely beloved Chairman’. His image hangs everywhere – in public places, schools, taxis, restaurants and living rooms – but exactly what he symbolises now is the question that China grapples with today.</p>

Along the way, you can stop to see the colourful figures of Taoist and Buddhist scripture on display in <strong>Shénzhōu Temple</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">神州祖庙; </span></span>Shénzhōu Zǔmiào), the grand and dignified <strong>Nányuè Martyrs Memorial Hall</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">南岳忠烈祠; </span></span>Nányuè Zhōngliècí), dedicated to the anti-Japanese resistance, and a <strong>stele</strong> inscribed with a dedication from Kuomintang leader Chiang Kaishek celebrating the pine forest. Before you jump on the cable car, take a break at <strong>Xuándōu Guàn</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">玄都观</span></span>), an active Taoist temple. The couplet carved at the entry reminds weary climbers that the path of righteousness is long, so don’t give up halfway through!</p>

                <p class="flush-left">The national park's official name is the Wǔlíngyuán Scenic &amp; Historic Interest Area, but almost everyone refers to it simply as Zhāngjiājiè, the name of one section of the park.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The park, covering a vast 264 sq km, is divided into three main areas: the <strong>Zhāngjiājiè</strong>, <strong>Tiānzǐ Shān</strong> and <strong>Suǒxī Valley</strong> scenic areas.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Zhāngjiājiè is also the name of the city (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">张家界市; </span></span>Zhāngjiājiè Shì) 30km south of the park, and the village (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">张家界村; </span></span>Zhāngjiājiè Cūn) by the 'Forest Park' entrance.</p>
              
              
                <p class="body-text">There are access points on all sides of the park, but most enter from the south, passing through Zhāngjiājiè village to the Zhāngjiājiè National Park entrance (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">张家界公园门票站; </span></span>Zhāngjiājiè Gōngyuán <em>ménpiàozhàn</em>), more commonly called Forest Park (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">森林公园; </span></span>Sēnlín Gōngyuán).

                <p class="body-text">Most rivers are pretty tame, so don't expect great thrills, but the scenery is fantastic. The actual rafting usually lasts about four hours, with about the same amount of time taken up in travel to and from the launch area.</p>
                <p class="body-text">A simply staggering admission fee includes ¥3 compulsory insurance and buys a ticket that is valid for two days. It must be used on consecutive days, and thumb prints are taken at the entrance, so tickets can't be resold or passed on. There are admission fees to some other sights within the park as well. Available from the ticket office, and hotels in the village and city, the <em>Tourist Map of Wulingyuan Scenic Zone</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">武陵源景区导游图; </span></span>¥5) contains an English-language map of the scenic area and a Chinese-language map of Zhāngjiājiè City.</p>

              <p class="box-body-text">It's a tough one-hour climb to the top (you're now in the Tiānzǐ Shān Nature Reserve), from where you can follow a short path to various viewpoints, including the famous <strong>No 1 Highest Natural Bridge</strong>. From here you can either hop on one of the free tourist buses, or walk along the main road (20 minutes) to <a href="ebook-28-hunan-chi15.xhtml#ref-44dc392df6d143a5bf9175ffdc3f2150">Zhōngtiān International Youth Hostel</a>, where you can either stop for the night, or just for lunch or a drink. Either way, don't forget to check out the path behind the hostel, which accesses two stunning viewpoints.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">The hostel is right beside <strong>Wàng Qiáo Tái</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">望桥台</span></span>) bus stop. From here, take a free bus about 30 minutes further up the mountain to the bus stop for the <strong>Grand Sightseeing Platform</strong>, and find a rarely taken trail, which starts near a place called <strong>One Dangerous Step</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">一步难行; </span></span><em>Yī Bù Nán Xíng</em>). Follow this cliff-hugging trail through dripping-wet forest and past numerous small waterfalls, until, after about an hour, you reach a small rural hamlet where, if it's getting late, you can stay the night in the rustic family guesthouse <a href="ebook-28-hunan-chi15.xhtml#ref-2b75421a94b81c70ea20a43f3a2bc619">Qíngrén Kèzhàn</a>. Or turn left to follow the lane back up to the main road where you can pick up another free bus, at <strong>Xiāng Dà Lù Kǒu</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">湘大路口</span></span>) bus stop, to the terminus at the <strong>Tiānzǐ Shān cable car station</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">天子山索道站; </span></span>Tiānzǐ Shān suǒdàozhàn).</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">It's ¥67 to descend in the cable car. Alternatively, follow the stepped path down (about one hour – the views are fabulous in places). At the bottom (you're now in the Suǒxī Valley area) you can take the <strong>monorail</strong> <strong>tram-car</strong> (¥52 one way, 10 minutes) or walk another 20 minutes to a bus depot. From the depot you can either take a free bus 10km to the Wǔlíngyuán park entrance (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">武陵源门口; </span></span>Wǔlíngyuán <em>ménkǒu</em>), from where buses head back to Zhāngjiājiè City (¥12, 45 minutes), or turn right to get back to the path where you began your hike. After a few hundred metres you'll reach the bottom of the Bǎilóng Elevator before continuing for about 90 minutes along the Golden Whip Stream Scenic Route again, back to the Zhāngjiājiè entrance.</p>

                <p class="box-flush-left">A free alternative to Zhāngjiājiè national park, this staggeringly beautiful mountain valley and its caves, natural arches and vertiginous cliffs, 90 minutes by bus from town, makes for a sublime day trip or overnight expedition. And it's free to enter. You begin by descending through a beautiful flat valley called <strong>Moon Valley</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">月之谷; </span></span>Yuè Zhi Gǔ) surrounded by limestone cliffs before climbing to a vast cave called <strong>Cathedral Gate</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">教堂们; </span></span>Jiàotáng Mén), after which you thread through a bamboo forest to make your way towards a 1km-long <strong>subterranean cave</strong>.</p>
              
              
                <p class="box-flush-left">On the way you will pass the <strong>Two Layer Cave</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">双层洞; </span></span>Shuāngcéng Dòng) before reaching the astonishing <strong>Angel Castle</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">天使城; </span></span>Tiānshǐ Chéng) – a formation of vast limestone cliffs that encircles you – with the <strong>Angel Gate</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">天使门; </span></span>Tiānshǐ Mén) at the far end, a further cave that drills through the entire cliff to the far side.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">A low-hanging cave entrance on the far side of the valley leads to the <strong>Mí Cave</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">迷洞; </span></span>Mí Dòng), but whatever you do, don't enter without a <strong>guide</strong> and a <strong>head lamp</strong>. It's 1km long, pitch black, devoid of mobile signals and if you take a wrong turn, you could easily get lost. But it's an astonishing experience. One section is full of litter, not dropped by visitors, but swept in by river waters that flow in here during the rainy season (though usually only to a shallow depth). Eventually – after about half an hour of walking in the dark – you will see the faint glow of the exit, a cavernous opening leading to a breathtaking valley called <strong>Star Valley</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">星之谷; </span></span>Xīng Zhī Gǔ) surrounded by colossal limestone cliffs. Give a good shout: the echo acoustics are phenomenal.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">Not far away is <strong>Bīngláng Hole</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">槟榔孔; </span></span>Bīnláng Kǒng), another natural cave leading through to the other side, from where you can make your way back to the bus drop-off point. Locals still use the naturally formed cave to reach villages on the far side, thus avoiding a circuitous detour.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">To reach Bīngláng Valley, take a bus (¥17, 90 minutes) towards Qīng'ān Píng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">青安坪</span></span>) from the west bus station (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">汽车西站; </span></span><em>qìchē xīzhàn</em>) on Ziwu Lu (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">子午路</span></span>) in Zhàngjiājiè City and disembark at Bīnglángǔ Nóngjiā Lè (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">槟榔谷农家乐</span></span>), simply the name of a family homestead by the valley access point. Buses leave at 8.20am and 1.30pm; the last bus back is at 3.30pm. It is, however, best to take a guide; arrange one through the <a href="ebook-28-hunan-chi15.xhtml#ref-0dc8d4e60aacd8c507a3735325195dde">Bājiè Youth Hostel</a>. Cheng Lifeng is an expert guide who takes visitors for around ¥100 per person; he does not speak much English, however, but should be able to arrange an English-speaking guide for you.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">If you want to spend the night here, <a href="ebook-28-hunan-chi15.xhtml#ref-bb296687ab3c7671a2c921b29fb72689">Bīnglángǔ Nóngjiā Lè</a> at the drop-off point has simple and cheap rooms for around ¥40 and can cook meals, but the hosts don't speak any English.</p>

          <p class="body-text">Admission to the old town includes guided two-hour tours in Chinese. If you enter via any of the alleys connecting to the main roads, you may get in for free, but you won’t be allowed into the notable buildings without a ticket and you may also be stopped by a random ticket-checker and directed to the ticket office.</p>
          <p class="body-text">The old town undulates in a delightful, higgledy-piggledy, often steep, maze of narrow stone-flagged alleys and lanes. Many of the less important buildings remain in a charming state of dilapidation, but a consistent program of restoration is underway. English and Chinese signposts point the way to the more notable buildings, most of which have been fully restored, and there's a metal map on a board at the heart of town for you to consult. Notable buildings include the <strong>tax office</strong>, an <strong>opium shop</strong>, a <strong>brothel</strong>, a <strong>pharmacy</strong>, a <strong>newspaper office</strong>, <strong>ancestral halls</strong>, <strong>courtyard homes</strong> of prominent merchants as well as several <strong>guildhalls</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">会馆; </span></span><em>huìguǎn</em>), including the superb facade of the <strong>Tàipíng Palace</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">太平宫; </span></span>Tàipíng Gōng).</p>

              <p class="flush-left">The Liú Yuán is a magnificent old house – it's now lived in by several families, but it used to belong to a wealthy merchant and is named after the garden in Sūzhōu; it stands in front of a colossal courtyard. Most buildings are of the <em>yìnzǐwū</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">窨子屋</span></span>) style, characterised by a series of adjoining courtyards, high exterior walls and concave roofs. You can enter many to admire their interiors; look out for the numerous <strong>Tàipíng Gāng</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">太平缸</span></span>), huge water vats for putting out fires.</p>

        <p class="flush-left">The road between Jíshǒu and Zhāngjiājiè runs through hills, terraced fields and minority villages, and past rivers and lush, verdant scenery via the Tujia settlement of Fúróng Zhèn (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">芙蓉镇</span></span>), an old town (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">古镇; </span></span><em>gǔzhèn</em>) elevated to fame in the 1986 film <em>Hibiscus Town</em>. Until around 10 years ago, the town was simply called Wáng Cūn (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">王村; </span></span>Wang Village), before being renamed in honour of the movie. Wandering down the steps of the old riverside town is charming, but the main draw is the gushing waterfall alongside the hamlet, splendidly illuminated come nightfall.</p>
      
      
        <p class="body-text">Wandering down the main old village street (admission ¥110), which descends in steps to the wharf and the Yǒu River (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">酉水</span></span>) at its foot, is a charming excursion. Historic buildings on the way down include the <span class="name">Guanyin Hall</span> <span class="practicalities">(</span><span class="practicalities"><span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">观音阁; </span></span>Guānyīn Gé</span> <span class="practicalities">No 105</span><span class="practicalities">)</span> at No 105 and the <span class="name">Tóngzhù Guǎn</span> <span class="practicalities">(</span><span class="practicalities"><span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">铜柱馆</span></span></span> <span class="practicalities">No 15</span><span class="practicalities">)</span>. The highlight, however, is the <span class="anchor" id="ref-f887ca66251f74229eeb4e81c6b64624"/><span class="name">Fúróng Zhèn Waterfall</span> <span class="practicalities">(</span><span class="practicalities"><span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">芙蓉镇瀑布; </span></span>Fúróng Zhèn Pùbù</span> <span class="practicalities">included in old town ticket</span><span class="practicalities">)</span>, which divides the village and can be crossed via stepping stones to the far side, affording the most amazing views of the town, especially at sundown as the lights begin twinkling. Have a camera ready. Note: it's possible to slip into the old town without paying, but you won't be able to enter any of the ticketed sights.</p>
      
      
        <p class="body-text">There are numerous hotels and guesthouses where you can find a double room with shower for the night for around ¥100. If you want a room overlooking the falls, you can find rooms for around ¥150.</p>
      
      
        <p class="body-text">There are a few restaurants on your left as you walk down the main steps to the river, with tables overlooking the waterfall, which serve up a variety of local and regional dishes, including nationwide home-style fare. Expect to pay around ¥20 to ¥40 for mains.</p>
      
      
        <p class="body-text">Most of the restaurants overlooking the falls also double as spots where you can sit back with a beer; they stay open till late, especially during the summer months. Shops selling locally fermented rice wines, costing from around ¥15 for half a <em>jīn</em> (300g), line the path down to the river.</p>
      
      
        <p class="body-text">Regular buses (¥25, one hour) run between Jíshǒu north bus station and Fúróng Zhèn from 7.30am to 5pm. Take the bus for Wáng Cūn (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">王村</span></span>), the old name for Fúróng Zhèn. Buses (¥30, 90 minutes) run every hour from the bus station in Fúróng Zhèn to Zhāngjiājiè between 7.30am and 5pm.</p>
