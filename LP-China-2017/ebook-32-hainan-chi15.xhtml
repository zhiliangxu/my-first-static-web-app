        <h3>Why Go?</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">China’s largest tropical island boasts all the balmy weather, coconut palms and gold-sand beaches you could ask for. Down at Sānyà it’s see-and-be-seen on the boardwalks or escape altogether at some of Asia’s top luxury resorts. Thatched huts and banana pancakes haven’t popped up anywhere yet, but there’s a hint of hipness coming from the east coast beachside towns, and the budding surf scene is helping to spread the gospel of chill out.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Money is pouring into Hǎinán (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">海南</span></span>) these days to ramp up the luxury quotient. You can cruise on the high-speed rail, but cycling is still the better way to get around. When you’ve had enough of a lathering on the coast, the cool central highlands are an ideal place to be on two wheels. The good roads, knockout mountain views, and concentration of Li and Miao, the island’s first settlers, give the region an appealing distinction from the lowlands.</p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Until the economic boom of the last 30 years, Hǎinán had been a backwater of the Chinese empire since the first Han settlements appeared on the coast almost 2000 years ago. Largely ignored by a series of dynasties, Hǎinán was known as the ‘tail of the dragon,’ ‘the gate of hell’, and a place best used as a repository for occasional high-profile exiles such as the poet Su Dongpo and the official Hai Rui.</p>
        <p class="body-text">More recently, China’s first communist cell was formed here in the 1920s, and the island was heavily bombarded and then occupied by the Japanese during WWII. Li and Han Chinese guerrillas waged an effective campaign to harass the Japanese forces but the retaliation was brutal – the Japanese executed a third of the island’s male population. Even today resentment over Japanese atrocities lingers among the younger generation.</p>
        <p class="body-text">In 1988 Hǎinán was taken away from Guǎngdōng and established as its own province and Special Economic Zone (SEZ). After years of fits and starts, development is now focused on turning tropical Hǎinán into an ‘international tourism island’ by 2020. What this really means, besides developing every beach, and building more golf courses and mega-transport projects (such as a high-speed rail service around the island, a cruise-ship terminal and even a spaceport), is not entirely clear.</p>
      
    </div>
    <div class="history">
      <h3>Climate</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">The weather on Hǎinán is largely warm in autumn and winter, and hot and humid in spring and summer. The mountains are always cooler than the coast, and the north is cooler than the south. Hǎinán is hit by at least one typhoon each year, usually between May and October.</p>

    <div class="info">
      <p class="info-heading-1 getting-there-around"><samp class="font-icon">8</samp>Getting There &amp; Around</p>
      
        <p class="info-flush-left">Both Hǎikǒu and Sānyà have international airports. Hǎikǒu, the capital city on the island’s north coast, is the point of entry for long-distance buses and trains coming from the mainland. And yes, there’s no bridge: even trains cross the Qióngzhōu Strait on the ferry.</p>
      
      
        <p class="info-flush-left">Getting around most of Hǎinán is both cheap and easy. A high-speed rail service makes a loop around the island and buses ply the three main expressways (east, west and central). The train is quicker and costs only slightly more than buses; however, most stations are not centrally located and require a bus or taxi transfer to the main town.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">Hǎikǒu (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">海口</span></span>) means ‘Mouth of the Sea’, and while sea trade remains relatively important, the buzzing provincial capital at the northern tip of Hǎinán is most notable for its booming construction. New and restarted projects are everywhere.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Hǎikǒu doesn’t have much in the way of sights, save for its restored downtown; however, there are some decent beaches a short bike or bus ride away, the air is fresh and clean (though worsening yearly because of traffic), and some visitors find themselves quite satisfied just hanging out here for a few days.</p>

            <p class="box-flush-left">Travellers from countries with diplomatic relations with China – except for the US and France – may apply for a visa on arrival at the airport in Hǎikǒu or Sānyà for stays of up to 15 days. You must be arriving on an international flight (so if you transfer in-country you are not eligible). However, keep in mind that the same arbitrary approval process applies here and in rare cases travellers have been rejected. Some travellers also report not being able to board flights as ground crew may not be aware of the latest visa regulations.</p>

            <p class="box-flush-left">Wǔzhǐshān (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">五指山; </span></span>Five Finger Mountain), the highest peak in the land, rises 1867m out of the centre of Hǎinán. It is the symbol of the island and is naturally steeped in local lore: the five peaks, for example, are said to represent the Li people’s five most powerful gods. It is also the source of the Wànquán (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">万泉河</span></span>) and Chānghuà (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">昌化江</span></span>) rivers and part of the Wǔzhǐshān National Nature Reserve, a rich, threatened ecosystem containing 6.5% of all vascular plant species in China.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">At the time of research, local authorities were making it very hard for foreign travellers to visit Wǔzhǐshān. You must apply for a permit through a licensed travel agency at least a week in advance – though your permit may be rejected or remain pending for no reason (as ours was) – and be accompanied by a guide. Should you receive permission and decide to climb, know that it is pretty much an all-day event to reach the summit and back. Most people can reach the top of the first finger (the second is highest) in three hours. The path is clear but very steep and includes a number of ladder climbs further up. Coming down is not much faster than going up, so give yourself six to eight hours. Be sure to bring plenty of water, as there are no amenities on the mountain.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">Wǔzhǐshān sits about 4km from the village of Shuǐmǎn (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">水满</span></span>), 30km northeast of Wǔzhǐshān City. You’ll need to first take a bus to Wǔzhǐshān City from Bǎotíng (¥10, 40 minutes, hourly), Hǎikǒu (¥80, four hours, seven daily) or Sānyà (¥28, 1½ hours, frequent) and then transfer to a local bus to Shuǐmǎn (¥10, one hour, hourly 7.30am to 5.30pm). Buy your ticket on the bus, which leaves across the street from the Wǔzhǐshān City bus station, 50m to the right. Make sure to get a bus going to Shuǐmǎn via Nánshèng. In Shuǐmǎn, motorcycle taxis will take you the remaining 4km for ¥15. The last bus back to Wǔzhǐshān leaves Shuǐmǎn around 5.30pm.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">Hǎinán’s reputation rests on its tropical beaches, but for many travellers it’s in this region of dark-green mountains and terraced rice-growing valleys that they make genuine contact with the island’s culture. Bǎotíng, with its rainforest and hot springs, is the most accessible destination. With more time, and especially if you’re on two wheels, you can head to Wǔzhǐshān, Qióngzhōng and their surrounding villages.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Until recently, Han Chinese had left almost no footprint here, and even today visible signs of Chinese culture, such as temples or shrines, are very rarely seen. Instead, the region is predominantly Li and Miao – minority ethnic groups who have lived a relatively primitive subsistence existence for most of their time on the island. Indeed, groups of Li living as hunter-gatherers were found in the mountainous interior of Hǎinán as recently as the 1930s. Today they are by far the poorest people on Hǎinán.</p>
        
        
          <p class="body-text">The central highlands have a good range of accommodation, from luxurious rainforest resorts to village guesthouses. Transport hubs like Wǔzhǐshān City have business hotels around the bus station if you find yourself stuck.</p>

          <h3>THE LI &amp; THE MIAO</h3>
          
            <p class="box-flush-left">The Li, who today number over one million and can only be found on Hǎinán, were the island’s first-known settlers, likely immigrating from southern China several thousand years ago. The Li were followed by the Miao (H’mong), who can also be found across stretches of northern Vietnam, Laos and Thailand; their arrival pushed the Li into the central highlands. When Han settlers arrived in big numbers during the Qing dynasty, they pushed the Miao, who in turn pushed the Li even further into the mountains.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">Today both populations occupy some of the most rugged terrain on the island, in the forested areas covering the Límǔlǐng Shān (Mother of the Li Mountain) range that stretches down the centre of the island. Since 1987, several counties in the central highlands have been designated as Li and Miao autonomous regions, which afford the minority groups a degree of independent governance.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">Visitors to the central highlands will see visual markers of Li culture, including architecture adorned with traditional geometric symbols and children in school uniforms hemmed with colourful embroidery.</p>

It’s a well-developed town with a large population of Li and Miao. The mountain entrance and hot-springs area are 8km out of town.

It’s a three-hour return trip to the top of the first point along a stepped path through a dense, healthy rainforest buzzing with bird and insect life. The final 100m climb to the peak runs up a pitted slope with chains and railings in place to aid your near-vertical climb. The views from the top are worth the effort. Purchase tickets at the excessively large park administration building at the entrance.</p>

Make sure not to catch a motorcycle with a side car as they lack the power to make it the last 4km from the hot springs area up to the trailhead.</p>

          <span class="anchor" id="ref-8a66e2b5469d0e1a966d45468e88b09b"/>
            <p class="box-flush-left">Hǎinán is a great destination for recreational touring. You’re rarely more than an hour from a village with food and water, and never more than a few hours from a town with a decent hotel. At the same time, you’ll find most of your riding is out in nature or through pretty farming valleys, not urban sprawl. Roads, even to minor villages, are generally in excellent condition (and new ones are being created regularly). Preparation time for a tour can be minimal.</p>
          
          <div>
            <h3>AROUND HǎIKǒU</h3>
            
              <p class="box-flush-left">A network of narrow, paved lanes connect the picturesque villages around the Hǎikǒu Volcanic Cluster Geopark, which are perfect for a day or afternoon trip. <a href="ebook-32-hainan-chi15.xhtml#ref-d455d90aca5caf4ca4d9edba0ddb50fa">Velo China</a> runs short, one- to three-hour cycling tours (free with the cost of bicycle rental, which starts at ¥80) that leave daily at 9am and 3pm from in front of the Mission Hills Resort; for reservations call 0898 6868 3888.</p>

            <h3>EAST COAST</h3>
            
              <p class="box-flush-left">The most popular of the multiday routes, because it is largely flat, runs from Hǎikǒu to Sānyà along the eastern highway, covering about 300km. The main road runs somewhat inland, though, so if you want to strike out along the coast, you’ll need a good map to follow the small roads that run to the seaside villages.</p>
            
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>CENTRAL HIGHLANDS</h3>
            
              <p class="box-flush-left">This is the most spectacular ride, if you have the stamina for it. The central highway, which runs 300km from Hǎikǒu to Sānyà via Wǔzhǐshān, has a good shoulder most of the way, and allows for endless side trips up small country roads and stops in tiny villages.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">After a day riding through the lush Túnchāng County valley, the route climbs into some fine hill country around Shíyùn (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">什运</span></span>). The village, 32km southwest of Qióngzhōng, sits on a grassy shelf above a river and is worth a look around. Local cyclists recommend the 42km side trip from here up a wooded canyon to Báishā (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">白沙</span></span>). The major towns in this area are Túnchāng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">屯昌</span></span>) and Qióngzhōng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">琼中</span></span>), the latter a major settlement for the Miao.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">After Shíyùn you can look forward to a long climb (at least 10km), followed by a long fast descent into Wǔzhǐshān. If you are continuing on to Sānyà, the road is one long, steep downhill after the turn-off to Bǎotíng.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">Hǎinán’s east coast is a series of spectacular palm-lined beaches, long bays and headlands, most of which are, unfortunately, not usually visible from the main roads, not even at bicycle level. With the best beaches developed or being developed, there is little reason to make a special trip out here (Bó’áo being the exception) unless you are surfing or wish to stay at a resort. Biking or motorcycling is another story, however, as there are endless small villages and rural roads to explore and even a few near-deserted bays.</p>
          <p class="body-text">In the past, the east coast was the centre of Han settlement. If you are coming from the highlands you will start to notice temples, grave sites, shrines and other signs of Chinese culture dotting the landscape.</p>
        
        
          <p class="body-text">We’ve heard reports of travellers camping on the undeveloped beaches with no trouble. There are camping facilities at <strong>Dà Huā Jiǎo</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">大花角</span></span>), a pretty beach with bobbing fishing boats at the end of the outstretched finger of land due east of Wànníng.</p>
        
        
          <p class="body-text">Frequent high-speed trains and buses run down the eastern side of the island, stopping at Qiónghǎi (for Bó’áo), Wànníng (for Rì Yuè Bay) and Língshuǐ.</p>
        
        
          <p class="body-text">Note that the eastern highway runs quite a bit inland; if you’re keen to cycle along the coast, you’ll need a good map to navigate the tiny roads that flit in and out of the waterfront towns.</p>

            <p class="flush-left">For cyclists, Bó’áo (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">博鳌</span></span>) is a natural stop along the coast. For all travellers, it’s an unpretentious (though rapidly developing) beach town surrounded by pretty countryside. Just to the west are small villages of stone and brick buildings where locals dry rice in the middle of the lanes, and burn incense for their local folk deities in small shrines.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Officially Bó’áo is starting to cover a large area, but the ‘downtown’ blocks, where most travellers both stay and eat, are tiny. The beach is a five-minute walk away.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Avoid visiting during, or the week before, the Bó’áo Forum for Asia (BFA), an annual April meet-up of top-level officials, academics and economists exclusively from the Asia region. The town is pretty much closed off under the scrutiny of high-level security (there are even warships in the harbour).</p>

Rì Yuè Bay (Sun &amp; Moon Bay) is prime from November to January, but it’s possible to surf all year. With up to five breaks, the area is suitable for all levels; advanced surfers can try their luck on the Ghost Hotel waves. Unlike further south, Sun &amp; Moon Bay gets a bit chilly and overcast in the winter months, so light wetsuits are recommended.</p>

            <p class="flush-left">China’s premier beach community claims to be the ‘Hawaii of China', but ‘Moscow on the South China Sea’ is more like it. The modern, hyper-developed resort city has such a steady influx of Russian vacationers these days that almost all signs are in Cyrillic as well as Chinese. Middle-class Chinese families are increasingly drawn to the golden shores of Sānyà (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">三亚</span></span>) as well.</p>
            <p class="body-text">While the full 40km or so of coastline dedicated to tourism is usually referred to as Sānyà, the region is actually made up of three distinct zones. Sānyà Bay is home to the bustling city centre and a long stretch of beach and hotels aimed at locals and mainland holidaymakers. Busy, cheerfully tacky Dàdōnghǎi Bay, about 3km southeast, beyond the Lùhuítóu Peninsula, is where most Western travellers stay. A further 15km east, at exclusive Yàlóng Bay, the beach is first-rate, as is the line of plush international resorts.</p>

                <p class="flush-left">Dàdōnghǎi Bay sports a wider beach than Sānyà and has a shaded boardwalk running along most of its length. The setting, in a deep blue bay with rocky headlands, is simply gorgeous, but it does get busy here. At night, half the crowd is knocking back beers and eating crabs at the boardwalk restaurants, while the other half is still bobbing in the sea under the light of the moon.</p>

                <p class="flush-left">Yàlóng Bay is the most picture-perfect of Sānyà’s beaches, though jet skis and banana boats do buzz through (there are roped-off swimming areas in the shallows). This is resort central, with all the attendant luxuries. Budget travellers will want to head to the main plaza for fast-food and coconut stands.</p>
              
              
                <p class="body-text">China’s beaches are theoretically open to everyone, but at Yàlóng Bay there can be a quasi-official entry fee if you’re not staying at one of the beachfront resorts. To avoid any sporadically enforced fees, walk through one of the hotels rather than entering the beach from the main square. No one will bother you.</p>

            <p class="flush-left">A glut of hotel rooms makes even luxury resorts affordable in Sānyà. Dàdōnghǎi Bay is the place to head for midrange and budget lodgings catering to the international set. Hòuhǎi Beach has a row of beachside guesthouses and a backpacker vibe. The top-end resorts are at Yàlóng Bay, in a private area of palm-lined roads and landscaped grounds. Outside peak periods 30% to 60% discounts are common everywhere.</p>
