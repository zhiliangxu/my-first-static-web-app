      <h3>Great Wall History</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">The Great Wall (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">长城; </span></span>Chángchéng), one of the most iconic monuments on earth, stands as an awe-inspiring symbol of the grandeur of China’s ancient history. Dating back 2000-odd years, the Wall snakes its way through 17 provinces, principalities and autonomous regions. But nowhere is better than Běijīng for mounting your assault on this most famous of bastions.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Official Chinese history likes to stress the unity of the Wall through the ages. In fact, there are at least four distinct Walls. Work on the ‘original’ was begun during the Qin dynasty (221–207 BC), when China was unified for the first time under Emperor Qin Shihuang. Hundreds of thousands of workers, many of them political prisoners, laboured for 10 years to construct it. An estimated 180 million cu metres of rammed earth was used to form the core of this Wall, and legend has it that the bones of dead workers were used as building materials too.</p>
        <p class="body-text">After the Qin dynasty fell, work on the Wall continued during the Han dynasty (206 BC–AD 220). Little more was done until almost 1000 years later, during the Jin dynasty (1115–1234), when the impending threat of Genghis Khan spurred further construction. The Wall’s final incarnation, and the one most visitors see today, came during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), when it was reinforced with stone, brick and battlements over a period of 100 years and at great human cost to the two to three million people who toiled on it. During this period it was home to around one million soldiers.</p>
        <p class="body-text">The great irony of the Wall is that it rarely stopped China’s enemies from invading. It was never one continuous structure; there were inevitable gaps and it was through those that Genghis Khan rode in to take Běijīng in 1215.</p>
        <p class="body-text">While the Wall was less than effective militarily, it was very useful as a kind of elevated highway for transporting people and equipment across mountainous terrain. Its beacon tower system, using smoke signals generated by burning wolves’ dung, quickly transmitted news of enemy movements back to the capital. But with the Manchus installed in Běijīng as the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) and the Mongol threat long gone, there was little need to maintain the Wall, and it fell into disrepair.</p>
      
      
        <p class="body-text">The Wall’s decline accelerated during the war with Japan and then the civil war that preceded the founding of the new China in 1949. Compounding the problem, the communists didn’t initially have much interest in the Wall. In fact, Mao Zedong encouraged people living near it to use it as a source of free building materials, something that still goes on unofficially today. It wasn’t until 1984 that Mao’s successor Deng Xiaoping ordered that the Wall be restored in places and placed under government protection.</p>
        <p class="body-text">But classic postcard images of the Wall – flawlessly clad in bricks and stoutly undulating over hills into the distance – do not reflect the truth of the bastion today. While the sections closest to Běijīng and a few elsewhere have been restored to something approaching their former glory, huge parts of the Wall are either rubble or, especially in the west, simply mounds of earth that could be anything.</p>

            <p class="box-list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>Spring and autumn are good times to hike the Wall, when it's not too hot or cold.</p>

            <p class="box-list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>In winter it gets frigid at the Wall – it's always colder than in Běijīng – but you'll likely have many parts of it all to yourself, especially during the week.</p>
            <p class="box-list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>Do not hike the sections of the Wild Wall in the rain: it's too easy to slip and fall.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-3" id="ref-visiting-the-wall">Visiting the Wall</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">The heavily reconstructed section at Bādálǐng is the most touristy part of the Wall. Mùtiányù and Jīnshānlǐng are also restored sections. These can feel less than authentic, but have the advantage of being much more accessible (with cable cars, handrails etc). Huánghuā Chéng and Zhuàngdàokǒu are part-restored, part-'wild' and offer some short but challenging hikes. Unrestored sections of ‘Wild Wall’ include Gǔběikǒu and Jiànkòu, but there are many others. All of these can be reached using public transport (you can even get to Bādálǐng by train), although some people choose to hire a car to speed things up. Staying overnight by the Wall is recommended.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Tours run by hostels, or by specialist tour companies, are far preferable to those run by ordinary hotels or general travel companies. Not only do they cater to the needs of adventurous Western travellers, they don’t come with any hidden extras, such as a side trip to the Ming Tombs (a common add-on) or a tiresome diversion to a gem factory or traditional Chinese medicine centre. The following reputable companies and associations run trips to the Wall that we like.</p>

        <p class="body-text">You'll find places to stay at some parts of the Wall close to Běijīng – notably Mùtiányù – but most guesthouses and hotels cluster around the more remote sections, where staying overnight allows you to spend some proper time at the Wall. Gǔběikǒu, Jiànkòu, Zhuàngdàokǒu and Huánghuā Chéng all have reasonable sleeping options. Remember, that most places close from November to March.</p>
      
      
        <p class="body-text">Bādálǐng can be accessed by both bus and train. You get to Mùtiányù, Jīnshānlǐng, Zhuàngdàokǒu, Gǔběikǒu, Jiànkòu and Huánghuā Chéng by a combination of buses, or a bus and a taxi or minivan. A number of taxi operators make day trips to the Wall, as do some ordinary Běijīng taxi drivers. Agree on the price beforehand.</p>

        <p class="body-text">Mùtiányù (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">慕田峪</span></span>) is a recently renovated stretch of Wall that sees a lot of tourists and is fairly easy to reach from Běijīng. It’s also well set up for families, with a cable car, a chairlift and a hugely popular toboggan ride. Fewer tour groups come here than go to Bādálǐng, so the crowds are much more manageable.</p>
      
      
        <p class="body-text">Famed for its Ming-era guard towers and excellent views, this 3km-long section of wall is largely a recently restored Ming dynasty structure that was built upon an earlier Northern Qi dynasty edifice. With 26 watchtowers, the wall is impressive and manageable and, although it’s popular, most souvenir hawking is reserved to the lower levels.</p>

        <p class="flush-left"><strong>Location</strong> 130km from Běijīng</p>
        <p class="body-text"><strong>Price</strong> through ticket (Great Wall and town) ¥45, town only ¥20</p>
      
      
        <p class="body-text">The historic, far-flung town of Gǔběikǒu is just a village these days, but was once an important, heavily guarded gateway into Běijīng from northeast China. The village, split into two sections by a ridge, with the Great Wall running along it and a small tunnel running through it, contains plenty of old courtyard homes (plus lots of rebuilt ones) and half a dozen small temples. Various stretches of the Wall meet in and around the village, in a kind of Great Wall crossroads with lots of hiking options. One short stony stretch of wall dates from the far-off Northern Qi dynasty (AD 550–577). The other stretches are Ming. There are well-worn dirt pathways on or beside them, so hiking here isn't as dangerous as it can be at other unrestored sections of the Wall. You should still take great care, though.</p>
      
      
        <p class="body-text">There are two main sections of Wall here: the <strong>Coiled Dragon</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">蟠龙; </span></span>Pán Lóng), which runs along the ridge that cuts Gǔběikǒu village in two and which eventually leads to Jīnshānlǐng Great Wall, and <strong>Crouching Tiger Mountain</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">卧虎山; </span></span>Wò Hǔ Shān), on the other side of the Cháo Hé River (walk through the tunnel, cross the river bridge, and follow the steps you'll soon see on your right). Both make for fabulous hiking, although Crouching Tiger is extraordinarily steep. There are other short splintered sections of Wall, like the one that runs down from Coiled Dragon, past Great Wall Box House. The Wall here is less well defined than at other locations across Běijīng, but the scenery is lush, making for pleasant hiking. Pathways along the Coiled Dragon section have yellow spray-paint markers left over from a Great Wall marathon a few years back, so navigation is less confusing than it might otherwise be.</p>

        <p class="body-text">For stupefying hikes along perhaps Běijīng’s most incomparable section of ‘Wild Wall’, head to the rear section of the Jiànkòu Great Wall (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">后箭扣长城; </span></span>Hòu Jiànkòu Chángchéng), accessible from Xīzhàzi village (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">西栅子村; </span></span>Xīzhàzi Cūn), via the town of Huáiróu. Tantalising panoramic views of the Great Wall spread out in either direction from here, as the crumbling brickwork meanders dramatically along a mountain ridge; the setting is truly sublime. But this is completely unrestored wall, so it is both dangerous and, strictly speaking, illegal to hike along it. On summer weekends especially, crowds can render it even more risky. Footwear with very good grip is required, and never attempt to traverse this section in the rain, particularly during thunderstorms. When the weather is fine, the Jiànkòu (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">箭扣</span></span>) area offers fabulous opportunities to hike and camp along the Wall.</p>
      
      
        <p class="body-text">Xīzhàzi village is actually a collection of five hamlets (<em>duì,</em> <span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">队</span></span>) strung out along a valley. To the left of the valley is a forested ridge, along the top of which runs the Great Wall. You can access the Wall from a number of points along this valley. If you're aiming to hike all the way to Mùtiányù Great Wall, turn left when you hit the Wall. The Wall here has various features that have been given names according to their appearance. They include: the <strong>Ox Horn</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">牛角边</span></span>, Niú Jiǎo Biān; 90 minutes walk to Mùtiányù), which performs a great sweeping, 180-degree u-turn; the <strong>Sharp North Tower</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">正北楼</span></span>, Zheng Bei Lou; 3½ hours to Mùtiányù), which is the highest tower you can view to your left when standing in hamlet No 5; the <strong>Arrow Nock</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">剪扣</span></span>, Jiànkòu; six hours), a low pass in the ridge; and <strong>Upward Flying Eagle</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">鹰飞到仰</span></span>, Ying Fei Dao Yang; nine hours), consisting of three beacon towers, two of which (the wings) stand on the highest point of the mountain above the lower, middle one (the eagle's head).</p>
        <p class="body-text">The H25 bus terminates at the end of the valley road, at hamlet No 5 (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">五队; </span></span><em>wǔ duì</em>). From here you can access pathways to Upward Flying Eagle (beyond the village) and Arrow Nock (back towards hamlet No 4). Before the bus gets that far, though, it passes through a decorative archway at the entrance to the valley. Here you'll have to get out to buy an entrance ticket to the scenic area (¥25). Hamlet No 1 (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">一队; </span></span><em>yī duì</em>) is just through this archway, to your left. You can walk from here to the Ox Horn in about 90 minutes.</p>

        <p class="body-text">The Jīnshānlǐng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">金山岭</span></span>) section of the Great Wall is a completely restored and, in places, very steep stretch, but it's so far from Běijīng that it sees far-fewer tourists than other fully restored sections. It contains some unusual features such as Barrier Walls (walls within the Wall), and each watchtower comes with an inscription, in English, detailing the historic significance of that part of the Wall. The landscape here can be drier and starker than at, say, Jiànkǒu or even nearby Gǔběikǒu, but it's arguably more powerful, and it leaves you in no doubt that this is remote territory. This is the finish point of an adventurous 6½-hour hike from Gǔběikǒu.</p>
      
      
        <p class="body-text">Hiking (in either direction) on the restored section of the Wall here is straightforward. There's an east gate and a west gate (about 2km apart), which means you can do a round trip (90 minutes) without backtracking; from the east gate, turn right at the Wall to find the west gate, then right again once back down on the road. At the time of writing, though, the east gate was closed, so you can only get onto the Wall from the west gate. If you need it, there’s a <span class="name">cable car</span> <span class="practicalities">(</span><span class="practicalities"><span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">缆车; </span></span>Lǎn Chē</span> <span class="practicalities">1 way/return ¥40/80</span><span class="practicalities">; </span><img alt="icon-hoursgif" class="prac-icon" src="images/icon-hours.gif"/><samp class="font-prac-icon">h</samp><span class="practicalities">8am-5pm Apr-Oct, to 4.30pm Nov-Mar</span><span class="practicalities">)</span> by the west-gate ticket office. If you want to find some unrestored sections, turn right when you hit the Wall and just keep going. This stretch eventually leads to Gǔběikǒu (6½ hours), although you have to leave the Wall for an hour or two in order to walk around the boundary of a small military camp.</p>

              <p class="box-flush-left">Unrivalled for pure Wild Wall scenery, the Wall at Jiànkòu is very tough to negotiate. This short stretch, which passes through the 180-degree u-turn known as the Ox Horn, is equally hairy, but it soon links to an easier, restored section at Mùtiányù. Access the Wall from hamlet No 1 in Xīzhàzi village (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">西栅子村一队; </span></span>Xīzhàzi Cūn Yīduì). It takes an hour to reach the Wall from the village; from the sign that says 'this section of the Great Wall is not open to the public', follow a narrow dirt path uphill and through a lovely pine forest. When you reach a small clearing, go straight on (and down slightly), rather than up to the right. Later, when you hit the Wall, turn left. You'll climb/clamber up to, and round, the Ox Horn before descending (it's very slippery here) all the way to Mùtiányù, where cable cars, toboggan rides and transport back to Běijīng await.</p>

Access the Wall from Zhuàngdàokǒu village; turn right at the end of the village, by the small river, then follow the river (keeping it on your left) before turning right, up the hill between the houses, to climb a stony pathway. When you reach the Wall, turn right and keep going until you reach the last watchtower, where a path to the right leads down to the main road by the reservoir. Don't attempt to descend to the road via the last stretch of Wall here, as it is suicidally steep. You can pick up buses, such as the H14, to Huáiróu from here (until 6pm).</p>

The Wall eventually splits at a corner tower: turn left. Then, soon after you reach another tower from where you can see the reservoir far below you, the Wall crumbles down the mountain, and is impassable. Instead of risking your life, take the path that leads down to your left, just before the tower. This path eventually links up with the Wall again, but you may as well follow it all the way down to the road from here, where you’ll be able to catch the H21 bus back to Huáiróu from the lower one of the two large car parks.</p>

              <p class="box-flush-left">This scenic but manageable hike starts and finishes in the town of Gǔběikǒu and follows a curling stretch of the Wall known as the Coiled Dragon. From the Folk Customs Village (the southern half of Gǔběikǒu), walk up to the newly reconstructed <strong>Gǔběikǒu Gate</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">古北口关; </span></span>Gǔběikǒu Guǎn) but turn right up a dirt track just before the gateway. You should start seeing yellow-painted blobs, left over from an old marathon that was run here: follow them. The first section of Wall you reach is a very rare stony stretch of <strong>Northern Qi Dynasty Wall</strong> (1500 years old). It soon joins up with the Ming dynasty bricked version, which you should continue to walk along (although at one stage, you need to follow yellow arrows down off the Wall to the left, before rejoining it later). Around 90 minutes after you set off, you should reach a big sweeping right-hand bend in the Wall (the coil), with three towers on top. The first and third of these towers are quite well preserved, with walls, windows and part of a roof (great for camping in). At the third tower (called <strong>Jiangjun Tower</strong>), turn left, skirting right around it, then walk down the steps before turning right at a point marked with a yellow 'X' (the marathon went straight on here). Follow this pathway all the way back to Gǔběikǒu (30 minutes), turning right when you reach the road.</p>

              <p class="box-flush-left">This daylong adventure takes in some ancient stone Wall, some crumbling unrestored brick Wall and some picture-perfect, recently renovated Wall, as well as a 90-minute detour through the countryside. Bring plenty of water and enough food for lunch. Follow the first part of our Coiled Dragon Loop hike, but instead of leaving the Wall just after <strong>Jiangjun Tower</strong>, continue along the Wall for another hour until you reach the impressive <strong>24-Window Tower</strong> (there are only 15 windows left these days). Here, follow the yellow arrows off the Wall, to avoid a military zone up ahead, and walk down through the fields for about 25 minutes. Take the first right, at another yellow arrow, beside a vegetable plot, and climb the path back towards the Wall. After about half an hour you'll pass <strong>Qing Yun Farmhouse</strong>, where you may be able to buy food and drinks (but don't bank on it). It's a 25-minute climb up to the Wall from here (at the fork, the left path is easier). At the Wall, walk through the cute doorway to get up around the other side of the tower, then continue along the Wall to the restored section at Jīnshānlǐng. You'll have to buy a ticket from someone at <strong>Xiliang Zhuandao Tower</strong>, from where it's about 30 minutes to <strong>Little Jinshan Tower</strong> (for the path, or cable car, down to the west gate), or about 90 minutes to <strong>East Tower with Five Holes</strong> (for the path down to the east gate, from where it's a 30-minute walk to the bus back to Běijīng).</p>

        <p class="body-text">Less touristy than other parts of the Great Wall close to Běijīng, Huánghuā Chéng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">黄花城</span></span>) is an extremely rewarding, and impossibly steep, section of the Wall. Undulating across the hillsides east and west of a small reservoir and offering spectacular views of the surrounding countryside, it has undergone only partial restoration and is refreshingly free of the hawkers who can make visits to other sections a trying experience. There are good opportunities for hikes too.</p>
      
      
        <p class="body-text">Strikingly free of crowds, Huánghuā Chéng allows visitors to admire this classic and well-preserved example of Ming defence, with its high and wide ramparts, intact parapets and sturdy beacon towers, in relative isolation. The patchy and periodic restoration work on the Wall here has left its crumbling nobility and striking authenticity largely intact, with the ramparts occasionally dissolving into rubble and some of the steps in ruins.</p>
        <p class="body-text">From the road, you can go either west (left) towards Zhuàngdàokǒu or east (right) up the stupidly steep section, which rises from the reservoir and eventually leads to Jiànkòu (after about two days). For the eastern route, cross the small dam, pay the enterprising local who sells unofficial ¥3 entrance tickets, and follow the path beside the reservoir. Walk up the steps just after the small shop-cum-cafe until you reach a metal ladder which is used to access the Wall. The Wall climbs abruptly uphill through a series of further watchtowers before going over, dipping down, then climbing again, even more steeply than before.</p>
        <p class="body-text">To head west, climb the path that leads up to the Wall from behind <a href="ebook-12-great-wall-chi15.xhtml#ref-848a5b429f801a8b3842a043ff5c9c25">Ténglóng Hotel</a> and which ends at a watchtower which leads onto the Wall itself. The Wall on this side of the road is almost as steep as on the eastern side and, in places, equally smooth and slippery. The views from the top are stunning, though, and you can continue from here to Zhuàngdàokǒu village (45 minutes); turn left off the Wall at its lowest point.</p>

You’ll have to put up with huge crowds of domestic tourists, a lot of souvenir hawkers and a Wall that was completely renovated in the 1980s and so lacks a true sense of historical authenticity. But the Bādálǐng Wall is highly photogenic, as well as authentically steep, has good tourist facilities (restaurants, disabled access, cable cars etc) and can be visited on a half-day trip from Běijīng.</p>

It dates to Ming times (1368–1644), but underwent particularly heavy restoration work during the 1950s and 1980s, when it was essentially rebuilt.</p>

It goes to the east car park at Bādálǐng. From there, walk uphill a little, turn left through a covered souvenir-shop strip, then left again at the end and uphill to the ticket office, which is between two large fortified archways. Buses return to Běijīng from just south of where they drop you: you'll see the queue of people waiting for them. The last bus back leaves at 5pm (4.30pm November to March).</p>
