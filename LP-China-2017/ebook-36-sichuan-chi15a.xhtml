      <h2>Southern Sìchuān</h2>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Not often on the radar of foreign tourists, steamy southern Sìchuān is for those who enjoy digging into history and exploring the quiet side of nature. There are dinosaur fossils, ancient cliff-face hanging coffins, lush bamboo forests and ancient riverside villages to explore. It’s also home to some stellar teahouses.</p>

            <p class="flush-left">This intriguing riverside city has been an important centre of Chinese salt production for almost 2000 years. Remnants of that industry make up part of an unconventional list of sights that includes the world’s deepest traditional salt and China’s first dinosaur museum. Zìgòng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">自贡</span></span>) is also a clear contender for the most atmospheric teahouses anywhere in Sìchuān, so there’s plenty of opportunity to just put your feet up for a day.</p>

                <p class="body-text">The first publicised finds here were made in 1972. The huge numbers of fossils, mostly dating from the rarely seen early and middle Jurassic periods, baffled archaeologists at first. It is now believed that floods swept them here en masse. Budding palaeontologists will appreciate the <em>Huayangosaurus taibaii,</em> the most primitive and complete stegosaur ever discovered, as well as the incredibly rare skin fossil specimens on display.

                <p class="flush-left">This fascinating museum is also a working salt mine. Its 1001m-deep artesian salt well was the world’s deepest well when it was built in 1835 and it remains the deepest salt well ever made using percussion drilling, a technique invented here and later applied throughout the world.</p>
              
              
                <p class="body-text">Many pieces of original equipment, including a 20m-high wooden derrick that towers above the tiny, 20cm-wide mouth of the well, are still intact. On the 2nd floor of the salt house, rows of cauldrons bubble away day and night over fires powered by natural gas, the mine's other product, until only fluffy white piles of glistening salt remain.</p>
                <p class="body-text">There are excellent English captions explaining the process, from how bamboo was once used to siphon brine from beneath the earth to how soy milk is added to clarify it. Bags of the salt (from ¥3.50) are sold from the window to the right when you exit.</p>

Wander through forests of this fast-growing grass, in an atmosphere so quiet that you can actually seem to hear it growing, or float through the foggy sky on either of the two cable cars.

        <h3>Dangers &amp; Annoyances</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">The roads in western Sìchuān are infamously bad, but many sections have been resurfaced in recent years and as a result travel times have been cut drastically. The occasional tumbled vehicle at the bottom of steep drops still attests to the danger of these highways, however, and with road work still ongoing in some areas it's not all smooth driving.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div class="history">
        <h3>Health</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">At these elevations, altitude sickness and acute mountain sickness (AMS) are possible concerns, especially for those looking to get out into nature for long periods.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Western Sìchuān endures up to 200 freezing days per year, but sunny summer days can be blistering. This, combined with the high altitude, can leave new arrivals vulnerable to bad sunburn in addition to altitude sickness. Pack layers and take a couple of days to acclimatise when you arrive and as you continue to gain elevation.</p>

          <h3>PERMITS</h3>
          
            <p class="box-flush-left">In 2009, after a dozen foreign climbers died on Sìchuān's mountains, the Chinese government began to enforce permit regulations. Officially, climbing any Sìchuān peak above 3500m requires registration through the <a href="ebook-36-sichuan-chi15.xhtml#ref-4bedbf4151c0d46f35987c177d4dbcdd">Sìchuān Mountaineering Association</a>. When your plans involve more than a standard hike (for example, rock climbing, ice climbing, extended backpacking), you should at least register with the mountain's administrative office (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">管理</span></span>) by the park's entrance gate. You may have to pay an environmental protection fee (from ¥150), and at popular but treacherous mountains such as <strong>Sìgūniáng</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">四姑娘</span></span>), hire a guide (from ¥300 per day).</p>

          <p class="info-flush-left">The recent completion of a number of high-altitude airports can cut travel times drastically, and more are on the way. Consider flying into Dàochéng and out of Qīnghǎi province's Yùshù, or in and out of Kāngdìng or the soon-to-open Gānzī airport. Flight prices can vary drastically depending on season and demand, so check Chinese booking sites such as <strong>Ctrip</strong> (<a href="http://english.ctrip.com/ChinaFlights">http://english.ctrip.com/ChinaFlights</a>) for current prices.</p>

          <p class="info-flush-left">In most cities throughout the region, one or two buses leave early each morning, with no more scheduled services throughout the day. To fill the gap, private drivers head to points throughout the province based on demand. You'll need to establish whether you want private hire – <em>bāochē</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">包车</span></span>) or a shared vehicle – <em>pīnchē</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">拼车</span></span>) – and if shared you'll usually need to wait around a while until the car fills up. Prices fluctuate based on demand and whim, and if you can't find a ride you're willing to pay for you may well need to try again the next morning.</p>
          <p class="info-body-text">Shared vehicles usually fill up quickly in the morning and more slowly as the day drags on. If possible, try to find a driver the day before and establish a departure time to guarantee yourself a seat.</p>

            <p class="body-text">This town has long stood as a trading centre between the Tibetan and Han, with sizeable Hui and Qiang minority populations also part of the mix; you'll find elements of all these cultures represented here.

This closure has extended to Sìchuān’s Ābà and Gānzī Prefectures before as well, though not in recent years.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">If the situation were to change, the town of Bātáng (due west of Lǐtáng) is a popular gateway into the province for locals in Southern Garzi Prefecture, while the stretch of highway between Dégé and Báiyù in the north of the prefecture has a score of bridges that enter Tibet via remote and rarely touristed rural regions.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">The famous Sìchuān–Tibet Hwy splits in two just west of Kāngdìng. The northern route is 300km longer than the southern route, and is generally less travelled. Following it, you’ll traverse high-plateau grasslands and numerous Tibetan settlements, usually attached to a local monastery.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Come here prepared. Bring warm clothing; it can be frigid at these elevations even in midsummer, and snow is not unheard of. Bus services can be unreliable. At times the government closes all or part of the region (particularly Larung Gar and Yarchen Gar) to foreign travellers with no notice beyond an entrance checkpoint with a soldier saying you won't be allowed in. This is no place to be in a hurry.</p>
          <p class="body-text">The payoff, however, comes in visiting remote Tibetan towns and monasteries, many of which carry on traditions that have existed in the region for centuries. This was once the realm of great kingdoms and marauding nomads – traces of these still exist if you search hard enough.</p>

Wander the temples and observe the 200 monks living here, then explore the maze of lanes that wind among the red and white houses clinging to the hillside.</p>
                
                
                  <p class="body-text">The original monastery, built in 1665, grew to be one of the six most influential monasteries of the Nyingma (Red Hat) sect. It has been restored and rebuilt several times, and at its height had more than 1000 monks before it was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. The monastery was rebuilt in 1982 with a combination of private and government funds.</p>
                  <p class="body-text">The monastery has a small printing operation in a building just uphill from the main halls. On the 2nd floor, you can watch carvers create delicate script in reverse as they cut away intricate designs out of small wooden blocks.</p>
                  <p class="body-text">The monastery village infrastructure remains rudimentary; raw sewage flows onto the paths after rains. There are no restaurants or guesthouses, so head back down into the modern town below.</p>
                  <p class="body-text">From the Báiyù bus station the temple is a 2km slog uphill through the lanes of the modern city, or accessible by car via a steep paved road on the northern edge of town.</p>

Take it in by hiking among the <em>chörten</em> and <em>mani</em> stones, beneath snowcapped Chola Mountain to the west, whose melt-waters feed the lake. You can walk for a couple of hours up the foothills on the left side of the lake for more breathtaking views and possible glimpses of white-lipped deer (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">白唇鹿; </span></span><em>báichúnlù</em>).</p>
                  <p class="body-text">You can also ride horses led by guides (from ¥100). Camping is frowned upon – though some self-sufficient travellers have slept in the caves without trouble. In summer you may also run into local monks setting up colourful tents.</p>
                  <p class="body-text">To get here, take a Dégé-bound minibus (¥20 to ¥40), hitch a ride or hike (turn right out of Mǎnígāngē Pání Hotel and keep going for two hours). The lake is a 10-minute walk from the main road, along an easy track. Minivans (¥20) wait to take you back to Mǎnígāngē.</p>

Lama Tsemper was a revered local hermit who spent much of his life meditating in a cave about two hours across the grasslands from Tǎgōng. Local nuns would bring him food and look after him, so when he requested a temple be built here just before his death in the 1980s it was decided that a nunnery be built too.</p>

                <p class="box-flush-left">The magnificent Yàdīng Nature Reserve, 140km south of Dàochéng, centres around three sacred snowcapped mountains, a holy trinity encircled by forested valleys, crystal-clear rivers and glacier-fed lakes. These are, quite simply, some of the most stunning landscapes you'll ever see. There are opportunities to hike, ride and camp here.</p>
              
              
                <p class="box-flush-left">Locals have worshipped these mountains for more than 800 years. The three peaks – Chenresig (compassion), Chana Dorje (power) and Jampelyang (wisdom) – represent bodhisattvas in Tibetan Buddhism. Even for nonbelievers, walking the 35km <em>kora</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">转山; </span></span>holy hike) around the highest peak, Chenresig (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">仙乃日; </span></span>Xiānnǎirì), which tops out at 6032m, can be a hugely meaningful experience.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">The clockwise circuit around Chenresig begins at <strong>Lóngtóng Bà</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">龙同坝</span></span>) and takes at least 12 hours of serious hiking. To avoid one very long day, many use the campsites located about halfway, just below the first pass beyond Five-Colour Lake. You have to bring all your own gear and supplies. (Though you'll pass locals living in simple stone huts, under park rules they are not supposed to take you in.) Remember to keep the mountain on your right, and to always take the right-hand turn when there’s a choice of paths. There is a longer, four-day, 110km hike that adds a circuit around 5958m <strong>Chana Dorje</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">夏郎多吉; </span></span>Xiàláng Duōjí), which begins and ends at the same place as the <em>kora</em>.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">These hiking trails are all around 4000m above sea level, so acclimatise properly and pack for a serious expedition before you set off. Guides are available for hire at Lóngtóng Bà.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">If you don’t have the time (or energy) for a full circuit, there are day-hike options that see far more visitors. Take the shuttle bus from the ticket office into the park, to the small settlement of Lóngtóng Bà. From here hike 3km to the 800-year-old <strong>Chonggu Monastery</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">冲古寺; </span></span>Chōnggǔ Sì), where you can pick up <strong>electric carts</strong> (one way/return ¥50/80, 6km, 20 minutes) into the <strong>Luòróng Grassland</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">洛绒牛场; </span></span>Luòróng Niúchǎng), which offers incredible views of the trinity and is as far as most tourists go. The other direction, uphill from Chonggu Monastery, is a 40-minute uphill hike to <strong>Zhuoma La</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">卓玛拉; </span></span>Zhuómă Lā). This small lake, just in the shadow of Chenresig's north face, is particularly impressive in spring when surrounded by blooming azalea flowers.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">It's worth continuing another 5km (three hours) to <strong>Milk Lake</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">牛奶海; </span></span>Níunǎi Hǎi) and stunning <strong>Five-Colour Lake</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">五色海; </span></span>Wǔsè Hǎi). You can also ride guided mules (one-way/return ¥200/300) for this segment, but keep in mind that even on four legs the round-trip journey takes 5½ hours on a steep, rocky trail. Riders must dismount multiple times to scramble alongside their ride for about a kilometre.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">Take a shared minibus (per person ¥50, 2½ hours) from Dàochéng to the small town of Rìwǎ (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">日瓦</span></span>), where you buy tickets for the reserve. The ticket includes a mandatory ¥120 shuttle-bus fee, so take the park shuttle bus the last 32km into the park (50 minutes); it stops first in Yàdīng village and then 3km later at Lóngtóng Bà.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">There are guesthouses and places to eat in <strong>Yàdīng village</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">亚丁村</span></span>). To get an early start on the <em>kora</em> sleep in a guesthouse in Yàdīng then catch the 7.30am shuttle the last few kilometres down to Lóngtóng Bà. Buses within the park run from the visitors centre between 7.20am and 5.40pm, and back from Lóngtóng Bà between 9am and 7.30pm.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">The best times to visit the reserve are May to June and September to early October.</p>

                  <p class="flush-left">Kelzang Gyatso (1708–57), the seventh Dalai Lama, was born in the basement of this house during a period of intense political struggle. He eventually grew into a visionary leader, and under his rule Tibet established a national archive, instituted civil-service training programs and formalised the Tibetan government structure. The house, built in the 16th century, is now Lǐtáng's best-preserved temple. While the building is officially open from 8am to 7pm, in practice hours are erratic.</p>
                
                
                  <p class="body-text">Not all Tibetans shared the belief Gyatso was the reincarnate; to escape the ongoing civil war, the Dalai Lama was raised and educated largely in exile. Qing Emperor Kangxi issued a proclamation affirming his identity, and in 1720 sent his son and troops to install the Dalai Lama to power in Lhasa. Mongol uprisings, rebellions and several coups later, the Dalai Lama gained the support of the clergy and the people.</p>
                  <p class="body-text">The main house is a series of rooms crowded with devotees lost in prayer, and displays of sacred relics of the Dalai Lama and the 13 other lamas born here. You may have to ask to see his actual birthplace, which is behind a door to the left of the entrance.</p>
                  <p class="body-text">To get here, walk along Genie Xilu (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">格聂西路</span></span>) after turning left past the China Post and just before King Gesar Sq (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">格萨尔广场; </span></span>Gésà'ĕr Guăngchăng). Turn right onto Renkang Gujie (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">仁康古街</span></span>) into the passage between No 72 and No 74 (marked by a number of large stones inscribed with Tibetan script).</p>
