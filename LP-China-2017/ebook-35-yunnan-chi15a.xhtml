      <h2>Northwest Yúnnán</h2>
      <div>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Northwest Yúnnán is a gorgeous blend of soaring mountains, pristine lakes and dizzyingly deep gorges and valleys. This is the part of Yúnnán to head to for epic treks: whether in the shadow of the 6000m peaks around Déqīn, or through the stunning Tiger Leaping Gorge. But the region is also home to the little-seen Nù Jiāng Valley, where Yúnnán meets both Tibet and Myanmar, and Lúgū Hú, a vast lake that straddles the Yúnnán–Sìchuān border and is home to the Mosuo people, the last matriarchal society in the world. If that wasn’t enough, there are also the towns of Shangri-la, with its intriguing blend of Tibetan and Han Chinese culture, and Lìjiāng, a Unesco World Heritage Site that sucks in both domestic and foreign visitors.</p>
        
        
          <p class="body-text">The main towns in the region – Lìjiāng and Shangri-la – have a wide range of hostels, guesthouses and hotels that cater to every budget and taste. You’ll also find many hostels and guesthouses in the popular trekking destinations around Déqīn, in Bǐngzhōngluò in the Nù Jiāng Valley, Lúgū Hú and Tiger Leaping Gorge. Elsewhere, accommodation options tend to be standard budget or midrange hotels.</p>
        
        
          <p class="body-text">Lìjiāng and Shangri-la have the best restaurants in Northwest Yúnnán, with many Chinese and Western options. In Lìjiāng, make sure to try the cuisine of the local Naxi minority, while Shangri-la is a great place to sample Tibetan cooking. More remote destinations, such as around Déqīn and the Nù Jiāng Valley, have far fewer restaurants and many people eat in their guesthouses.</p>
        
        
          <p class="body-text">Lìjiāng and Shangri-la are the only places in Northwest Yúnnán with airports and train stations (although the railway isn’t scheduled to reach Shangri-la until 2019), and from them you can connect to destinations across Yúnnán and beyond. But buses are the main way to get around this region and with roads winding through mountain passes, journey times can be long.</p>

            <p class="flush-left">How popular is this time-locked place? Lìjiāng’s (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">丽江</span></span>) maze of cobbled streets, rickety (or rickety-looking, given gentrification) wooden buildings and gushing canals suck in over <em>eight million</em> people a year. So thick are the crowds in the narrow alleys that it can feel like they've all arrived at the same time.</p>
            <p class="body-text">But remember the 80/20 rule: 80% of the tourists will be in 20% of the places. Get up early enough and you can often beat the crowds. And when they do appear, that’s the cue to hop on a bike and cycle out to one of the nearby villages.</p>

The old town is where you’ll be spending your time and it’s a jumble of lanes that twist and turn. If you get lost (and most do), head upstream and you’ll make your way back to the main square.</p>

            <p class="box-flush-left">Lìjiāng has been the homeland of the 300,000-odd Naxi (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">纳西; </span></span>pronounced 'na-see', also spelt Nakhi and Nahi) minority for about the last 1400 years. The Naxi descend from ethnically Tibetan Qiang tribes and lived until recently in matrilineal families. Since local rulers were always male it wasn’t truly matriarchal, but women still seemed to run the show.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">The Naxi matriarchs maintained their hold over the men with flexible arrangements for love affairs. The <em>azhu</em> (friend) system allowed a couple to become lovers without setting up joint residence. Both partners would continue to live in their respective homes; the boyfriend would spend the nights at his girlfriend’s house but return to live and work at his mother’s house during the day. Any children born to the couple belonged to the woman, who was responsible for bringing them up. The man provided support, but once the relationship was over, so was the support. Children lived with their mothers and no special effort was made to recognise paternity. Women inherited all property and disputes were adjudicated by female elders.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">There are strong matriarchal influences in the Naxi language. Nouns enlarge their meaning when the word for ‘female’ is added; conversely, the addition of the word for ‘male’ will decrease the meaning. For example, ‘stone’ plus ‘female’ conveys the idea of a boulder; ‘stone’ plus ‘male’ conveys the idea of a pebble.</p>

            <p class="body-text"><em>Bābā</em> is the Lìjiāng local speciality – thick flatbreads of wheat, served plain or stuffed with meat, vegetables or sweets. There are always several ‘Naxi’ items on menus, including the famous ‘Naxi omelette’ and ‘Naxi sandwich’ (goat’s cheese, tomato and fried egg between two pieces of local <em>bābā</em>). Try locally produced <em>qīng méi jiǔ</em> (a plum-based wine with a 500-year history) – it tastes like a semisweet sherry.</p>

          <h3>NAXI SCRIPT</h3>
          
            <p class="box-flush-left">The Naxi created a written language more than 1000 years ago using an extraordinary system of pictographs – the only hieroglyphic language still in use. The most famous Naxi text is the Dongba classic <em>Creation,</em> and ancient copies of it and other texts can still be found in Lìjiāng, as well as in the archives of some US universities. The Dongba were Naxi shamans who were caretakers of the written language and mediators between the Naxi and the spirit world. The Dongba religion, itself an offshoot of Tibet’s pre-Buddhist Bon religion, eventually developed into an amalgam of Tibetan Buddhism, Islam and Taoism.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">Useful phrases in the Naxi language are <em>nuar lala</em> (hello) and <em>jiu bai sai</em> (thank you).</p>

Alternatively, it's an ideal spot for lazing and cycling the surrounding area for a day or two.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Located on the plain north of Lìjiāng, Báishā was the capital of the Naxi kingdom until Kublai Khan made it part of his Yuan empire (1271–1368).

            <p class="body-text">A sprightly 94 at the time of writing and still treating the ill every day with herbs collected from the nearby mountains, Dr Ho is very chatty (he speaks English, German and Japanese) and is happy to regale visitors with the secrets of good health and longevity.

            <p class="body-text">There are a couple of <strong>frescos</strong> worth seeing in town and the surrounding area.

The last 3km of the track requires a steep climb. The monastery sits at the foot of Yùlóng Xuěshān (5500m) and was established in 1756. The monastery’s main attraction nowadays is the <strong>Camellia Tree of 10,000 Blossoms</strong> (Wànduǒ Shānchá). Ten thousand might be something of an exaggeration, but locals claim that the tree produces at least 4000 blossoms between February and April. A monk on the grounds risked his life to keep the tree secretly watered during the Cultural Revolution.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">Lìjiāng is also famed for its <strong>temple frescos</strong>, most of which were painted during the 15th and 16th centuries by Tibetan, Naxi, Bai and Han artists; many were restored during the later Qing dynasty. They depict various Taoist, Chinese and Tibetan Buddhist themes and can be found on the interior walls of temples in the area. Remember, though, that the Cultural Revolution caused havoc around here so many are desecrated in various ways.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">Frescos can be found in Báishā and on the interior walls of <strong>Dàjué Palace</strong> (Dàjué Gōng) in the village of Lóngquán.</p>

                <p class="box-flush-left">Also known as Mt Satseto, Yùlóng Xuěshān soars to some 5500m. Its peak was first climbed in 1963 by a research team from Běijīng and now, at some 35km from Lìjiāng, it is regularly mobbed by hordes of Chinese tour groups and travellers, especially in the summer.</p>
              
              
                <p class="box-flush-left">Buses from Lìjiāng arrive at a parking area where you can purchase tickets for the various cable cars and chairlifts that ascend the mountain. This is also where the <a href="ebook-35-yunnan-chi15a.xhtml#ref-9d92c0fb8a7b51e6925b54e251d34ef6">Impression Lijiang</a> show is held, a mega song-and-dance performance. Note that if you are going to the performance you will also have to pay the park admission fees. Close to the parking area is <strong>Dry Sea Meadow</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">干海子; </span></span>Gànhǎizi), a good spot for photographing the mountain.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">A <strong>cable car</strong> (¥180) ascends the mountain to an elevation of 4506m; from here you can walk up another 200m to a viewing point to see the glacier near the peak. It can often get chilly near the top so bring warm clothes. You will also have to pay ¥20 for the bus ticket to the base of the cable car.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">Back down at the parking lot you can switch to a bus that goes to <strong>Blue Moon Lake</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">蓝月湖; </span></span>Lányuè Hǔ) and <strong>White Water River</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">白水河; </span></span>Báishuǐ Hé), where a walking trail leads along the river up to the lake (the round-trip walk takes about 90 minutes). The cable-car bus ticket is also good for the bus to the lake.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">A 10-minute drive past Blue Moon Lake is <strong>Yak Meadow</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">牦牛坪; </span></span>Máoniú Píng), where a <strong>chairlift</strong> (¥85, plus ¥20 bus ticket) pulls visitors up to an altitude of 3500m.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">In summer, when crowds for the cable car are long (up to two hours' wait), most travellers just do the trip to the lake and Yak Meadow.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">Minibuses (¥30) leave from opposite Lìjiāng's Mao Sq. Returning to Lìjiāng, buses leave fairly regularly but check with your driver to find out what time the last bus will depart.</p>

That pretty much sums up Tiger Leaping Gorge (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">虎跳峡; </span></span>Hǔtiào Xiá), the unmissable trek of southwest China.</p>
            <p class="body-text">One of the deepest gorges in the world, it measures 16km long and is a giddy 3900m from the waters of the Jīnshā River (Jīnshā Jiāng) to the snowcapped mountains of Hābā Shān (Hābā Mountain) to the west and Yùlóng Xuěshān to the east, and, despite the odd danger, it’s gorgeous almost every single step of the way.</p>

            <p class="flush-left">There are two trails: the higher and the lower; the latter follows the road and is best avoided, unless you enjoy being enveloped in clouds of dust from passing tour buses and 4WDs. While the scenery is stunning wherever you are in the gorge, it’s absolutely sublime from the high trail. Make sure you don’t get too distracted by all that beauty, though, and so miss the blue signs and red arrows that help you avoid getting lost on the trail.</p>
            <p class="body-text">At the time of writing, a new road was being tunnelled through part of the gorge, resulting in a diversion at the start of the high trail which makes the route an hour or so longer. From the <span>Qiáotóu ticket office</span>, it’s seven hours to Běndìwān, nine hours to Middle Gorge (Tina’s Guesthouse), or 10 hours to Walnut Garden. It’s much more fun, and a lot less exhausting, to do the trek over two days. By stopping overnight at one of the many guesthouses along the way, you’ll have the time to appreciate the magnificent vistas on offer at almost every turn of the trail.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Ponies can be hired (their owners will find you) to take you to the gorge’s highest point for ¥200; it’s not uncommon to see three generations of a family together, with the oldies on horseback and the young ones panting along on foot behind them.</p>
          
          
            <p class="body-text">The main hiking route along the higher road starts at <a href="ebook-35-yunnan-chi15a.xhtml#ref-e6b3c6187ec74f4176adb17ed5da8516">Jane’s Tibetan Guesthouse</a>. Walk away from <strong>Qiáotóu</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">桥头</span></span>), past the school, for five minutes or so, then head up the paved road branching to the left; there’s a sign to guide you. After about 2.5km on the road, look for the blue sign pointing to the high trail diversion. The serious climbing starts straight away thanks to the diversion, with a steep ascent and then descent into <strong>Nuòyú</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">诺余</span></span>) village.</p>
            <p class="body-text">The toughest section of the trek comes after Nuòyu, when the trail winds through the 28 agonising bends, or turns, that lead to the highest point of the gorge. Count on six hours at normal pace to get through here and to reach <strong>Yāchà</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">牙叉</span></span>) village. It’s a relatively straightforward walk on to <strong>Běndìwān</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">本地湾</span></span>). About 1½ hours on from here, you begin the descent to the road on slippery, poor, precarious paths. Watch your step here; if you twist an ankle, it’s a long hop down.</p>
            <p class="body-text">After the path meets the road at <a href="ebook-35-yunnan-chi15a.xhtml#ref-eac8ba1a916c2203f31f26f06c9ed040">Tina’s Guesthouse</a>, there’s a good detour that leads down to the middle rapids and <span class="anchor" id="ref-0629e6cfcbba80feff7c860772c83bb5"/><span class="name">Tiger Leaping Stone</span> <span class="practicalities">(</span><span class="map-links">

Locals charge ¥15 to go down the path and it's a two hour round trip. At the bottom of this insanely steep trail locals charge another ¥15 for one viewpoint but another spot is free. From one of the lower rest points another trail (¥15) heads downstream for a one-hour walk to <strong>Walnut Garden</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">核桃园</span></span>).</p>
            <p class="body-text">Most hikers stop at Tina’s, have lunch, and head back to Qiáotóu. Those continuing to Walnut Garden can take the trail along the river or use an alternative trail that keeps high where the path descends to Tina’s, crosses a stream and a ‘bamboo forest’ before descending into Walnut Garden. If you are deciding where to spend the night, Walnut Garden is more attractive than Tina’s.</p>

              <h3>DANGERS OF THE TREK</h3>
              
                <p class="box-flush-left">The gorge hike is not to be taken lightly. Even for those in good physical shape, it’s a workout and can certainly wreck the knees. The path constricts and crumbles and is alarmingly narrow in places, making it sometimes dangerous. When it’s raining (especially in July and August), landslides and swollen waterfalls can block the paths, in particular on the low road. (The best time to come is May and the start of June, when the hills are afire with plant and flower life.)</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">A few people – including a handful of foreign travellers – have died in the gorge. During the past decade, there have also been cases of travellers being assaulted on the trail. It’s safer in all ways not to do the hike alone.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">Check with cafes and lodgings in Lìjiāng or Qiáotóu for trail and weather updates. Most have fairly detailed gorge maps; just remember they’re not to scale and are occasionally out of date.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">You can buy water along the way at the guesthouses on the route, but make sure to bring plenty of sunscreen and lip balm.</p>

            <p class="info-flush-left">From Lìjiāng's long-distance bus station there is one direct bus a day to Qiáotóu at 8.30am (¥22, 1½ hours). Otherwise, catch any bus to Shangri-la (¥40, 1½ hours, every 40 minutes, 7.30am to 5pm) and get off at Qiáotóu.</p>
            <p class="info-body-text">Some travellers get a minivan (¥35) to the start of the walking track, organised through their guesthouse in Lìjiāng. The minivan can deliver extra luggage to the guesthouse of your choice (usually <a href="ebook-35-yunnan-chi15a.xhtml#ref-eac8ba1a916c2203f31f26f06c9ed040">Tina’s</a> or <a href="ebook-35-yunnan-chi15a.xhtml#ref-e6b3c6187ec74f4176adb17ed5da8516">Jane’s</a>).</p>
            <p class="info-body-text">Returning to Lìjiāng from Qiáotóu, buses start passing through from Shangri-la at around 9.30am. The last one rolls through at around 8pm. The last bus to Shangri-la passes through at around 6.30pm. Tina’s Guesthouse also organises one bus a day to both Lìjiāng and Shangri-la (both ¥55) at 3.30pm. You can also pick up a bus to Lìjiāng from Walnut Garden at 3.30pm (¥55).</p>
            <p class="info-body-text">There is one daily bus to Báishuǐtái from Lìjiāng at 9am (¥38, three hours). There is also one bus a day from Shangri-la to Báishuǐtái at 9.40am (¥24, three hours).</p>

          <p class="flush-left">An adventurous add-on to the gorge trek is to continue north all the way to Hābā (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">哈巴</span></span>) village and the limestone terraces of <a href="ebook-35-yunnan-chi15a.xhtml#ref-a14754d757b1d53ebfc34647fb8667f5">Báishuǐtái</a>. This turns it into a four-day trek from Qiáotóu and from here you can travel on to Shangri-la. From Walnut Garden to <strong>Hābā</strong>, via Jiāngbiān (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">江边</span></span>), is a seven- to-eight-hour walk. From here to the Yi village of <strong>Sānbà</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">三坝</span></span>), close to Báishuǐtái, is about the same, following trails. You could just follow the road and hitch with the occasional truck or tractor, but it’s longer and less scenic. The best way would be to hire a guide in Walnut Garden (¥400 per day for an English-speaker). A horse will cost ¥250 to ¥300 per day extra. The turn-off to Hābā starts 6km down the road from Walnut Garden, up the hill where you see ‘Welcome to Tibet Guesthouse’ painted on the retaining wall.</p>
          <p class="body-text">There are a number of guesthouses In Hābā. <span class="name">Hābā Snow Mountain Inn</span> <span class="practicalities">(</span><span class="practicalities"><span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">哈巴雪山客栈; </span></span>Hābā Xuěshān Kèzhàn</span> <img alt="icon-phonegif" class="prac-icon" src="images/icon-phone.gif"/><samp class="font-prac-icon">%</samp><span class="practicalities">0888 7886 6596</span><span class="practicalities">; </span><span class="practicalities">dm ¥30, d ¥80-150</span><span class="practicalities">; </span><img alt="icon-wifigif" class="prac-icon" src="images/icon-wifi.gif"/><samp class="font-prac-icon">W</samp><span class="practicalities">)</span> has old dorms and newer double rooms. The enthusiastic host can organise guides to lead you up to the base camp of <strong>Hābā Mountain</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">哈巴山</span></span>, Hābā Shān), a two-day trek, or to <strong>Black Lake</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">黑海</span></span>, Hēi Hǎi), a nine-hour round-trip hike. Note that locals now charge a ¥200 'protection fee' per person for access to the mountain, supposedly going towards conservation efforts.</p>
          <p class="body-text">The daily bus to Sānbà passes <a href="ebook-35-yunnan-chi15a.xhtml#ref-eac8ba1a916c2203f31f26f06c9ed040">Tina's Guesthouse</a> around 1pm (¥40, three hours), but not if the road is blocked. One bus from Báishuǐtái to Shangri-la goes through Sānbà around noon (¥24, two hours). Minivans frequently ply these routes so flagging down a ride isn’t too tough.</p>
          <p class="body-text">If you plan to hike the route alone, assume you’ll need all provisions and equipment for extremes of weather. Ask for local advice before setting out.</p>

The ascent to the lake, which sits at 2690m, is via a spectacular switchback road and the first sight of the 50-sq-km body of water, surrounded by lushly forested slopes, will take your breath away.</p>

Although guesthouses make up most of the place, along with restaurants serving succulent, but pricey, barbecue, the sights and nights here are lovely.

            <p class="body-text">Home to one of Yúnnán’s most rewarding monasteries and surrounded by mountains, lakes and grassland, it's also the last stop in Yúnnán before a rough five- to six-day journey to Chéngdū via the Tibetan townships and rugged terrain of western Sìchuān.</p>
            <p class="body-text">The town is divided into two distinct sections: the larger modern side and the old quarter. A devastating fire in January 2014 sent much of the old town up in smoke, but it's now been almost completely rebuilt. Most of the places you'll visit in the new town are within walking distance of the old town, making getting around easy.</p>
          
          
            <p class="body-text">Plan your visit for between March or April and October. During winter, Shangri-la is still busy but it gets very cold indeed, although spectacular mountain views can be the reward for braving the frigid temperatures.</p>
            <p class="body-text">In mid- to late June, the town hosts a <strong>horse-racing festival</strong> that sees several days of dancing, singing, eating and, of course, horse racing. Accommodation is tight at this time.</p>

          <h3>JOSEPH ROCK</h3>
          
            <p class="box-flush-left">Yúnnán has always been a hunting ground for famous, foreign plant-hunters such as Joseph Rock (1884–1962). Rock lived in Lìjiāng between 1922 and 1949, becoming the world’s leading expert on Naxi culture and local botany.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">Born in Austria, the withdrawn autodidact taught himself eight languages, including Sanskrit. After becoming the world’s foremost authority on Hawaiian flora, the US Department of Agriculture, Harvard University and later <em>National Geographic</em> (he was their famed ‘man in China’) sponsored Rock’s trips to collect flora for medicinal research. He devoted much of his life to studying Naxi culture, which he feared was being extinguished by the dominant Han culture.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">Rock sent more than 80,000 plant specimens from China – two were named after him – along with 1600 birds and 60 mammals. His caravans stretched for half a mile, and included dozens of servants, including a cook trained in Austrian cuisine, a portable darkroom, trains of pack horses, and hundreds of mercenaries for protection against bandits, not to mention the gold dinner service and collapsible bathtub.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">Rock lived in Yùhú village (called Nguluko when he was there), outside Lìjiāng. Many of his possessions are now local family heirlooms.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">The <em>Ancient Nakhi Kingdom of Southwest China</em> (1947) is Joseph Rock’s definitive work. Immediately prior to his death, his Naxi dictionary was finally prepared for publishing.</p>

              <p class="box-flush-left">On 11 January 2014 much of Shangri-la's old town went up in flames, reducing the city's prime tourist attraction to a pile of smoking ashes.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">The fire was caused by an electrical fault in a guesthouse. Once it took hold, the old town – a tightly packed warren of narrow, twisting lanes and wooden houses – had no chance. Some 260 buildings, including 40 guesthouses, were destroyed.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">Thankfully, no one died in the inferno, a result of the fire services ordering an immediate evacuation of the area. Less impressive was the fact that their fire engines turned up without any water, resulting in them having to turn around and head to the nearest river to fill up.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">For many locals, the fire was an accident waiting to happen. Ever since Chinese 'experts' announced in 1997 that the city of Shangri-la and the surrounding area was the fabled Shangri-la of James Hilton's best-selling 1933 novel <em>Lost Horizon,</em> the city had expanded at a pace that far outstripped its infrastructure.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">Water shortages were common, while a lack of planning ensured the old town was nothing more than a fire trap, with locals opening shops, guesthouses and restaurants on top of each other to cash in on the tourism boom.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">Hilton's novel – likely inspired by articles written by the famed northwest Yúnnán explorer Joseph Rock – tells the story of four travellers who are hijacked and taken to a mountain utopia whose residents can live for over 150 years. In contrast, the 'real' Shangri-la lasted a mere 17 years before it had to be reconstructed.</p>

              <p class="info-body-text">If you’re up for the bus-hopping trek to Chéngdū in Sìchuān, you’re looking at a minimum of three to four days’ travel (often five to six) at some very high altitudes – you’ll need warm clothes. Note that for political reasons this road may be closed at any time of the year (if the ticket seller at the bus says ‘come back tomorrow’, it’s closed indefinitely for sure).</p>
              <p class="info-body-text">If you can get a ticket, the first stage of the trip is to Xiāngchéng in Sìchuān. From Xiāngchéng, your next destination is Lǐtáng, though if roads are bad you may be forced to stay overnight in Dàochéng.

            <h3>GETTING TO TIBET</h3>
            
              <p class="box-flush-left">At the time of writing, it was not possible to enter Tibet overland from Shangri-la, or anywhere in Yúnnán. If you’re tempted to try and sneak in, then think again. There are many checkpoints operating on the road between Shangri-la and Lhasa; you will be caught, fined, detained, escorted to Chéngdū by the police and deported at your own expense. Any local person believed to have assisted you (for example by giving you a ride) will get into worse trouble.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">It is possible to fly to Lhasa from Shangri-la, but flights are cheaper from elsewhere (Kūnmíng and Chéngdū), and you’ll need to be part of an organised group with all the necessary permits. By far the best people to talk to about Tibet travel in Shangri-la are <a href="ebook-35-yunnan-chi15a.xhtml#ref-72702c8291cfdc25e043dee94334aee7">Khampa Caravan</a>.</p>

There are four buses a day to Wéixi from Shangri-la's bus station at 8.30am, 10am, noon and 2pm (¥75, five hours); it's a bad road.</p>

                <p class="flush-left">Also known as Pǔdácuò (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">普达错</span></span>), a Mandarinised-version of its Tibetan name, Emerald Pagoda lake is 25km east of Shangri-la. The bus to Sānbà can drop you along the highway. From there, it's 8km down a trail (a half-hour by pony), and while the ticket price is laughably steep, there are other (free) trails to the lake. A bike is useful for finding them; taxis will drop you at the ticket office.</p>
              
              
                <p class="body-text">Pony trips can be arranged at the lake. An intriguing sight in summer are the comatose fish that float unconscious for several minutes in the lake after feasting on azalea petals.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The whopping entrance fee is also due to the inclusion of <strong>Shǔdū Hú</strong>, another lake approximately 10km to the north. The name means ‘Place Where Milk is Found’ in Tibetan because its pastures are reputedly the most fertile in northwestern Yúnnán.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Getting to the lake(s) is tricky. The easiest way is to go on a tour arranged by your hostel. Otherwise, catch the bus to Sānbà, get off at the turn-off and hitch. Getting back you can wait (sometimes interminably) for a bus or hike to one of the entrances or main road and look out for taxis – but there may be none. A taxi will cost around ¥300 to ¥400 for the return trip, including Shǔdū Hú.</p>

For good reason it has become probably the most popular back-door route between Lìjiāng and Shangri-la. The terraces – think of those in Pamukkale in Turkey or Huánglóng in Sìchuān – are lovely, but can be tough to access if rainfall has made trails slippery.</p>

Snugly cloud-high at an average altitude of 3550m, it rests in the near embrace of one of China’s most magical mountains, Kawa Karpo (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">梅里雪山; </span></span>Méilǐ Xuěshān). At 6740m, it is Yúnnán’s highest peak and straddles the Yúnnán–Tibet border.</p>
            <p class="body-text">A true border town, Déqīn is one of Yúnnán’s last outposts before Tibet, but from here you could also practically hike east to Sìchuān or southwest to Myanmar. Díqìng Prefecture was so isolated that it was never really controlled by anyone until the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) arrived in force in 1957.</p>
            <p class="body-text">More than 80% of locals are Tibetan, though a dozen other minorities also live here, including one of the few settlements of non-Hui Muslims in China. The town itself, though, is unattractive and for travellers it is simply a staging post to the nearby mountains. Confusingly, Déqīn is the name of the city and county; both are incorporated by the Díqìng Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">迪庆藏族自治州</span></span>).</p>

At over 13 sq km, it is not only the lowest glacier in China (around 2200m) but also an oddity – a monsoon marine glacier, which basically translates as having an ecosystem that couldn’t possibly be more diverse: tundra, taiga, broadleaf forest and meadow.</p>
              
              
                <p class="body-text">The mountain has been a pilgrimage site for centuries and you’ll still meet a few Tibetan pilgrims, some of whom circumambulate the mountain over seven days in autumn. Surrounding villages are known as ‘heaven villages’ because of the dense fog that hangs about in spring and summer.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The trail to the glacier leads up from Míngyǒng’s central square. After 70 minutes of steady uphill walking you will reach the Tibetan <strong>Tàizǐ Miào</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">太子庙</span></span>), a small temple where there are snack and drink stalls. A further 30 minutes along the trail is <strong>Lotus Temple</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">莲花庙; </span></span>Liánhuā Miào), which offers fantastic views of the glacier framed by prayer flags and <em>chörten</em>.

              <p class="box-body-text">From Yǔbēng village, there are loads of treks. It’s a three- to four-hour trip on foot or horseback to the waterfall. Or, you could head south to a picturesque lake (it’s around 4350m high and not easy to find, so take a guide). Guides cost around ¥200 per day. Supplies (food and water) are pricey in Yǔbēng so stock up in Fēilái Sì.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">Leaving the village, many travellers hike to <strong>Nínóng</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">尼农</span></span>) village by the Mekong River, a five-hour downhill trek that includes a hairy one-hour section along a precarious, narrow path. If you are prone to vertigo, head back to Xīdāng instead. Vans run to Déqīn and Fēilái Sì from Nínóng for ¥25 per person or ¥200 for the whole van. If you are stuck, walk 6km to Xīdāng where there is more transport.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">Then there’s the legendary Kawa Karpo <em>kora,</em> a 12-day pilgrim circumambulation of Méilǐ Xuěshān. However, half of it is in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, so you’ll need a permit to do it; and you’ll definitely need a guide.</p>
