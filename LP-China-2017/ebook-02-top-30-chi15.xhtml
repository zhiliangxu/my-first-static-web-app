No other place in China teems with so much history, legend and good old-fashioned imperial intrigue. You may get totally lost here but you’ll always find something to write about on the first postcard you can lay your hands on. The complex also heads the list with one of China’s most attractive admission prices and almost endless value-for-money sightseeing.</p>

Select the Great Wall according to taste: perfectly chiselled, dilapidated, stripped of its bricks, overrun with saplings, coiling splendidly into the hills or returning to dust. The fortification is a fitting symbol of those perennial Chinese traits: diligence, mass manpower, ambitious vision and engineering skill (coupled with a distrust of the neighbours).</p>

Its sights set squarely on the not-too-distant future, Shànghǎi offers a taste of all the superlatives China can dare to dream up, from the world’s highest observation deck to its fastest commercially operating train. Whether you’re just pulling in after an epic 44-hour train trip from Xīnjiāng or it’s your first stop, you’ll find plenty to indulge in here. Start with the <a href="ebook-20-shanghai-chi15.xhtml#ref-fcb5ad02f425565f4f95137d8ede4d5b">Bund</a>, Shànghǎi’s iconic riverfront area.</p>

Ride a bamboo raft along the river and you’ll understand why this stunning rural landscape has inspired painters and poets for centuries. Another popular way to appreciate the scenery is a bike tour along the Yùlóng River.</p>

A region that's a beguiling patchwork of minority villages and layers of waterlogged terraces climbing the hillsides, you’ll be enticed into a game of village-hopping. The most invigorating walk between Píng’ān and Dàzhài villages offers the most spine-tingling views. Visit after the summer rains when the fields are glistening with reflections.</p>

It’s not just that there are thousands of the life-sized figures lined up in battle formation; it’s the fact that no two of them are alike – each one is animated with a distinct expression. This is an army and one made up entirely of individuals. Gazing at these skilfully sculpted faces brings the past alive with a unique intensity.</p>

Rising from the misty subtropical forests of northwest Húnán, more than 3000 karst pinnacles form a landscape so surreal it is, arguably, unmatched by any other in China. Raft along a river, hike to your heart's content, walk along a petrifying glass walkway, or just spend hours filling up the memory card on your camera.</p>

Once home to the bulk of Shànghǎi’s adventurers, revolutionaries, gangsters, prostitutes and writers – though ironically many of them weren’t French – the former concession (also called Frenchtown) is the most graceful part of Pǔxī. The Paris of the East turns on its European charms to maximum effect here, where leafy streets and 1920s villas meet art deco apartment blocks, elegant restaurants and chic bars.</p>

Perhaps it’s the barren landscape, or an otherworldly vibe on the mountain. Mist – a fickle mistress – rolls in and out at will; spindly bent pines stick out like lone pins across sheer craggy granite faces. Not far from the base are the perfectly preserved Hui villages including <a href="ebook-24-anhui-chi15.xhtml#ref-bca867376e2b75e5b5611cd514a69c60">Xīdì</a> and Hóngcūn.

The imposing and well-defended bastions of wood and earth – not all circular it must be added – can be most easily found in the Fújiàn counties of Nánjìng and Yǒngdìng. Do the right thing and spend the night in one: this is a vanishing way of life, the pastoral setting is quite superb and the architecture is unique.</p>

        <p class="numbered-list">A visit to China just isn’t complete without scaling a sacred mountain or two, and antediluvian <a href="ebook-13-tianjin-chi15.xhtml#ref-a46c1f9f0ad8801727bef0cc7271ea2e">Tài Shān</a> in Shāndōng province is the granddaddy of them all. Climb the Taoist mountain and you’ll live to 100, they say, even if you feel you are going to drop dead with exhaustion on the gruelling Path of 18 Bends (lightweights can hitch a ride on the cable car instead). The views are outstanding and with Tài Shān’s mountainous aspect in the east, summit sunrises are the order of the day.</p>

        <p class="numbered-list">Snow melting from the world’s ‘third pole’ – the high-altitude Tibet–Qīnghǎi plateau – is the source of China’s mighty, life-giving Yangzi. The country’s longest river, the Yangzi surges west–east across the nation before pouring into the Pacific Ocean. It reaches a crescendo with the Three Gorges, carved out through the millennia by the inexorable persistence of the powerful waters. The gorges are a magnificent spectacle and a <a href="ebook-09-cruising-the-yangzi-chi15.xhtml#ref-ed9ab4a7da8ce41f2d3d634912f7d3ff">Yangzi River cruise</a> is a rare chance to hang up your travelling hat, take a seat and leisurely watch the drama unfold.</p>

        <p class="numbered-list">If you only have time for one attraction in Guǎngdōng, Kāipíng’s <a href="ebook-31-guangdong-chi15.xhtml#ref-7774d4b1652e738e6af0f15080e6eb0f">diāolóu</a> should be it. Approximately 1800 outlandishly designed watchtowers and fortified residences are scattered higgledy-piggledy in the farmland in Kāipíng, a town not far from Guǎngzhōu. These sturdy bastions built in the early 20th century may not be what you’d typically expect in the Middle Kingdom, but they inspire awe with their eccentric fusion of foreign and domestic architectural styles. Greek, Roman, Gothic, Byzantine and baroque – you name it, they’ve got it.</p>

        <p class="numbered-list">Worshipped by more than a billion Buddhists and Hindus, Asia’s most sacred <a href="ebook-43-tibet-chi15.xhtml#ref-37c8acbce9826c00e39b3677ba759243">mountain</a> rises from the Barkha plain like a giant four-sided 6714m-high <em>chörten</em> (stupa). Throw in stunning nearby Lake Manasarovar and a basin that forms the source of four of Asia’s greatest rivers, and it’s clear that this place is special. Travelling here to one of the world’s most beautiful and remote corners brings a bonus: the three-day pilgrim path around the mountain erases the sins of a lifetime.</p>

        <p class="numbered-list">The holy city of Lhasa is the perfect introduction to Tibet, and just arriving here can make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck. The spectacular prayer halls of the <a href="ebook-43-tibet-chi15.xhtml#ref-0ca684e79afe84754987246905e1bb77">Potala Palace</a>, the medieval Jokhang Temple and the monastic cities of Drepung and Sera are the big draws, but don’t miss the less-visited chapels and pilgrim paths. The whitewashed alleys of the old town hold the real heart of the Tibetan quarter, and you could spend hours here wandering around backstreet handicraft workshops, hidden temples and local teahouses.</p>

Hit the east for picturesque rice-growing valleys, spectacular bays and China's finest beaches. And don’t miss the sparsely populated central highlands, a densely forested region that’s home to the island’s original settlers, the Li and the Miao. Here, even the road more frequently taken is still not taken by many at all.</p>
