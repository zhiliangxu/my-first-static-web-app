          <p class="flush-left">The 320km-long Nù Jiāng Valley (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">怒江大峡谷</span></span>) is one of Yúnnán’s best-kept secrets. The Nù Jiāng (known as the 'Salween' in Myanmar; its name in Chinese means ‘Raging River’) is the second-longest river in Southeast Asia and a Unesco World Heritage Site.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Sandwiched between Gāolígòng Shān and Myanmar to the west, Tibet to the north and the imposing Bìluó Shān to the east, the gorge holds nearly a quarter of China’s flora and fauna species, and half of China’s endangered species. The valley also has an exotic mix of Han, Nu, Lisu, Drung and Tibetan nationalities, and even the odd Burmese trader. And it’s simply stunning – all of it.</p>
          <p class="body-text">But like other parts of rural Yúnnán, change is coming to the Nù Jiāng Valley. The local government is touting investment opportunities in everything from truffle farms to stone quarries, and the main towns – Liùkù and Fúgòng especially – are booming, with new apartment blocks and shops appearing and Han migrants arriving in numbers.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Nevertheless, the Nù Jiāng remains one of only two rivers that have not been dammed in all China and the signs are that it will, thankfully, stay that way. And getting here remains a pain, which is a good thing in terms of keeping the valley as pristine as is possible in China. Travellers, though, should be prepared for roads that can be impassable due to heavy rain and/or landslides.</p>
          <p class="body-text">All traffic enters via Liùkù. From there, you trundle nine hours up the valley, marvelling at the scenery, and then head back the way you came.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Plans have been announced to blast a road from Gòngshān in the northern part of the valley to Déqīn, and another from the village of Bǐngzhōngluò even further north into Tibet. Given the immense topographical challenges, these schemes are a long way off. But you should make sure to get here before they happen.</p>
        
        
          <p class="body-text">Almost all hotels, guesthouses and hostels are confined to the main towns in the Nù Jiāng Valley – Liùkù, Fúgòng and Gòngshān – and the village of Bǐngzhōngluò. You can find bearable rooms from ¥80 and up.</p>
        
        
          <p class="body-text">Liùkù is the main transport hub for the Nù Jiāng Valley and you will have to go through there for buses heading into the valley.</p>

From Yǒnzhī it’s another two hours' walk to the main road from where you can hitch a ride to Déqīn.

          <p class="body-text">There are a couple of basic hotels in the county capital Kǒngdāng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">孔当</span></span>) where you can find rooms from ¥80 to ¥100. Outside of Kǒngdāng, it might be possible to find a bed in a village (most are close to the main road), but bear in mind that the Dulong people are very shy and you'll hardly head any Mandarin, let alone English, here.</p>
          <p class="body-text">The main road in the valley itself is paved south towards the border with Myanmar (Burma) and north towards Tibet, but there are no hotels or restaurants outside Kǒngdāng. Strong cyclists will have a field day, but bring your own tent and food.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Although the road into the valley has been upgraded, no buses run here. Minivans make the four-hour, 96km trip infrequently (¥100 per person, or hire one for ¥600).</p>

      <h2>Bǎoshān Region <span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">保山</span></span></h2>
      <div>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Scrunched up against Myanmar and bisected by the wild Nù Jiāng, the Bǎoshān (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">保山</span></span>) region is a varied landscape that includes thick forests, dormant volcanoes and hot springs.</p>
          <p class="body-text">The eponymous capital is unremarkable; lovely Téngchōng (and its environs) is where it’s at. The Téngchōng area is peppered with minority groups whose villages lie in and around the ancient fire mountains.</p>
        
        
          <p class="body-text">As early as the 4th and 5th centuries BC (two centuries before the northern routes through Central Asia were established), the Bǎoshān area was an important stop on the southern Silk Road – the Sìchuān–India route. The area did not come under Chinese control until the Han dynasty. In 1277 a huge battle was waged in the region between the 12,000 troops of Kublai Khan and 60,000 Burmese soldiers and their 2000 elephants. The Mongols won and went on to take Bagan.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-3" id="ref-tengchong-county">Téngchōng County</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Some highlights of this region are the traditional villages that are scattered between Téngchōng and Yúnfēng Shān (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">云峰山; </span></span>Cloudy Peak Mountain). The relatively plentiful public transport along this route means that you can jump on and off minibuses to go exploring as the whim takes you. Otherwise, hire a taxi or minivan for a day tour for around ¥300.</p>

              <p class="flush-left">With 20 volcanoes in the vicinity, lots of hot springs and great trekking potential, there’s plenty to explore in this neck of the woods. Téngchōng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">腾冲</span></span>) itself is a bit of an oddity – one of the few places in China that, though much of the old architecture has been demolished, remains a pleasant place to hang out, with oodles of green space (you can actually smell the flowers!) and a friendly, low-key populace.</p>

            <p class="flush-left">Téngchōng County is renowned for its volcanoes, and although they have been behaving themselves for many centuries, the seismic and geothermal activity in the area indicates that they won’t always continue to do so. The closest volcano to Téngchōng is <strong>Mǎ’ān Shān</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">马鞍山; </span></span>Saddle Mountain), around 5km to the northwest. It’s just south of the main road to Yíngjiāng.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Around 22km to the north of town, near the village of <strong>Mǎzhàn</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">马战乡</span></span>), is the most accessible cluster of <strong>volcanoes</strong> (¥40). The main central volcano is known as <strong>Dàkōng Shān</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">大空山; </span></span>Big Empty Hill), which pretty much sums it up, and to the left of it is the black crater of <strong>Hēikōng Shān</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">黑空山; </span></span>Black Empty Hill). You can haul yourself up the steps for views of the surrounding lava fields (long dormant).</p>
          
          
            <p class="body-text">To visit the volcanoes around Mǎzhàn from Téngchōng, take a Gùdōng-bound bus (¥15) from the West Gate bus station on Huoshan Lu and get off at Mǎzhàn, From there, it’s a 10-minute walk to the volcano area, or you can take a motor-tricycle (¥5). Once you are in the area there is a fair bit of walking to get between the sights, or you can hitch rides.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Getting out to the villages around Téngchōng is a bit tricky. Catching buses part of the way and hiking is one possibility, hiring a taxi for the day (¥300) is another.</p>

            <p class="flush-left">Back in the 1980s this border town was a notorious haven for drug and gem smugglers, prostitution and various other iniquities. The government cleaned it up in the late 1990s (on the surface anyway) and today you’re more likely to stumble into a shopping mall than a den of thieves. Still, Ruìlì has an edge to it, thanks to its proximity to a notoriously anarchic region of Myanmar and a thriving gem market operated largely by Burmese traders. And with its palm-tree-lined streets, bicycle rickshaws and steamy climate, it has a distinctly laid-back, Southeast Asian feel.</p>
            <p class="body-text">The minority villages nearby are also good reason to come and it’s worth getting a bicycle and heading out to explore. Another draw is Myanmar, just a few kilometres away. Though individual tourists are not allowed to cross freely, organising permits to take you through the sensitive border area is becoming easier.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">North of Myanmar and Laos, Xīshuāngbǎnnà is the Chinese approximation of the original Thai name of Sip Sawng Panna (12 Rice-Growing Districts). The Xīshuāngbǎnnà region (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">西双版纳</span></span>), better known as Bǎnnà, has become China’s mini-Thailand, attracting tourists looking for sunshine, water-splashing festivals and epic jungle treks.</p>
          <p class="body-text">But Xīshuāngbǎnnà is big enough that it rarely feels overwhelmed by visitors and even the expanding capital, Jǐnghóng, remains reasonably laid-back.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div class="history">
        <h3>Environment</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Xīshuāngbǎnnà has myriad plant and animal species, although recent scientific studies have shown the tropical rainforest areas of Bǎnnà are now acutely endangered. The jungle areas that remain contain a handful of tigers, leopards and golden-haired monkeys. The number of elephants has doubled to 250, up 100% from the early 1980s; the government now offers compensation to villagers whose crops have been destroyed by elephants, or who assist in wildlife conservation. In 1998 the government banned the hunting or processing of animals, but poaching is notoriously hard to control.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div class="history">
        <h3>People</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">About one-third of the million-strong population of this region are Dai; another third or so are Han Chinese and the rest are a conglomerate of minorities that include the Hani, Lisu and Yao, as well as lesser-known hill tribes such as the Aini (a subgroup of the Hani), Jinuo, Bulang, Lahu and Wa.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Xīshuāngbǎnnà Dai Autonomous Prefecture, as it is known officially, is subdivided into the three counties of Jǐnghóng, Měnghǎi and Měnglà.</p>
        
        <div class="box-text box two-column">
          <h3>MINORITY GROUPS OF XīSHUāNGBǎNNà</h3>
          
            <p class="box-flush-left">The Dai (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">傣族</span></span>) are Hinayana Buddhists (as opposed to China’s majority Mahayana Buddhists) who first appeared 2000 years ago in the Yangzi Valley and were subsequently driven south to here by the Mongol invasion of the 13th century. The common dress for Dai women is a straw hat or towel-wrap headdress, a tight, short blouse in a bright colour, and a printed sarong with a belt of silver links. Some Dai men tattoo their bodies with animal designs, and betel-nut chewing is popular. The Dai language is quite similar to Lao and northern Thai dialects. Some Dai phrases include <em>douzao li</em> (hello), <em>yindi</em> (thank you) and <em>goihan</em> (goodbye).</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">The Jinuo people (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">基诺族</span></span>), sometimes known as the Youle, were officially ‘discovered’ as a minority in 1979 and are among the smallest groups – numbering between 12,000 and 18,000. They call themselves ‘those who respect the uncle’ and are thought to possibly have descended from the Qiang. The women wear a white cowl, a cotton tunic with bright horizontal stripes and a tubular black skirt. Earlobe decoration is an elaborate custom among older women – the larger the hole and the more flowers it can contain, the more beautiful the woman is considered.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">The Bulang people (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">布朗族</span></span>) live mainly in the Bùlǎng, Xīdìng and Bādá mountains of Xīshuāngbǎnnà. They keep to the hills farming cotton, sugar cane and <em>pǔ’ěr</em> tea, one of Yúnnán’s most famous exports. Men traditionally tattoo their arms, legs, chests and stomachs while women wear vibrant headdresses decorated with flowers.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">The Hani (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">哈尼族</span></span>), who are sometimes confused with the Akha, are closely related to the Yi as a part of the Tibeto-Burman group; the language is Sino-Tibetan but uses Han characters for the written form. They are mostly famed for their river-valley rice terraces, especially in the Red River valley, between the Āiláo and Wúliàng Shān, where they cultivate rice, corn and the occasional poppy. Hani women (especially the Aini, a subgroup of the Hani) wear headdresses of beads, feathers, coins and silver rings, some of which are decorated with French (Vietnamese), Burmese and Indian coins from the turn of the 20th century.</p>

        <h3>Climate</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">The region has two seasons: wet and dry. The wet season is between June and August, when it rains ferociously, although not every day and only in short bursts. From September to February there is less rainfall, but thick fog descends during the late evening and doesn’t lift until 10am or even later.</p>
          <p class="body-text">November to March sees temperatures average about 19°C. The hottest months of the year are from April to September, when you can expect an average of 25°C.</p>

          <h3>ETIQUETTE IN DAI TEMPLES</h3>
          
            <p class="box-flush-left">Around Dai temples the same rules apply as elsewhere: dress appropriately (no sleeveless tops or shorts); take off shoes before entering; don’t take photos of monks or the inside of temples without permission; leave a donation if you do take any shots and consider leaving a token donation even if you don’t – unlike in Thailand, these Buddhists receive no government assistance. It is polite to <em>wai</em> (clasp your hands together in a prayer-like greeting) the monks and remember to never rub anyone’s head, raise yourself higher than a Buddha figure or point your feet at anyone. (This last point applies to secular buildings too. If you stay the night in a Dai household, it is good form to sleep with your feet pointing towards the door.)</p>

          <p class="flush-left">There are hotels and hostels aplenty in Jǐnghóng. Basic guesthouses are sometimes available in the villages, or locals will offer a bed. Make sure to pay for it: around ¥50 for a bed and meal is the going rate.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">Bǎnnà is home to some of the best food in all China. Sour and spicy Dai food in particular is excellent, drawing on both Chinese and Southeast Asian influences. Dai dishes include barbecued fish, eel or beef cooked with lemongrass or served with peanut and tomato sauce. The region's fertile earth guarantees superb fruit and vegetables too.</p>

          <p class="info-flush-left">Jǐnghóng is the main transport hub for Xīshuāngbǎnnà, with air and bus connections to the rest of Yúnnán. Měnghǎi, about an hour west of Jǐnghóng by bus, is another key transport node for reaching many of Xīshuāngbǎnnà's outlying villages, including Xīdìng, Měnghùn and Jǐngzhēn. Frequent buses from Jǐnghóng's No 2 Bus Station travel to Měnghǎi's bus station, where you can pick up buses and minivans to the villages. You can also get direct buses from Jǐnghóng to destinations in Laos, including Luang Nam Tha and Luang Prabang, while there's also the possibility of hitching a ride on a cargo boat down the Mekong to northern Thailand. But there is still no overland access to Myanmar from here.</p>

        <h3>BǎNNà BORDER CHECKPOINTS</h3>
        
          <p class="box-flush-left">At the time of writing, normally sleepy Bǎnnà was a hive of police activity, especially along the borders with Laos and Myanmar (Burma). The reason for this is the increase in the number of Uighurs – the restive Muslim ethnic minority group native to far-off Xīnjiāng Province – attempting to flee China across what are normally the country's most porous frontiers.</p>
          <p class="box-body-text">Any bus or car travelling close to the borders will be stopped at any number of checkpoints and the IDs of all passengers scrutinised. It is absolutely essential for all travellers to carry their passports with them when journeying around the border areas. The police will be unimpressed if you have no proof of who you are and where you are from.</p>

            <p class="flush-left">Jǐnghóng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">景洪</span></span>) – the ‘City of Dawn’ in local Dai language – is experiencing some serious investment. The once-sleepy capital of Xīshuāngbǎnnà Prefecture is expanding fast, with new apartment blocks sprawling down both sides of the Mekong River (known as the Láncāng in China) which bisects the city and ambitious developments sprouting on the city's outskirts.</p>
            <p class="body-text">The once underpopulated left bank of the Mekong is at the heart of the boom, meaning the city's axis is beginning to shift from its traditional centre on the right bank. Nevertheless, Jǐnghóng sees relatively few Western visitors and it remains laid-back despite the increasingly snarled traffic. And everything from the food to the weather has more in common with Southeast Asia than China.</p>

Piracy and drug-related violence has largely put an end to that adventurous route south, though. But you can ask about hitching a ride on a cargo boat. They leave from Guānleì (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">关累</span></span>), about 75km southeast of Jǐnhóng. The <a href="ebook-35-yunnan-chi15b.xhtml#ref-24664c3c590c92f18069066947659c9c">Mekong Cafe</a> can put you in touch with a boat captain. If you get a ride, expect to pay ¥800 to ¥1200 per person for the trip. Alternatively, head into Laos and then skip over the Thai border.</p>

You could spend weeks doing so, but even with limited time most destinations in Xīshuāngbǎnnà are only two or three hours away by bus. Note that to get to the most isolated villages, you’ll often first have to take the bus to a primary (and uninteresting) village and stay overnight there, since only one bus per day – if that – travels to the tinier villages.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Market addicts can rejoice – it’s an artist’s palette of colours in outlying villages. The most popular markets are the Thursday market in Xīdìng and Měnghùn's Saturday market. Měngyǎng is another popular village destination, thanks to its famous elephant-shaped banyan tree.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Take note: it can feel like every second village begins with the prefix ‘Meng’ and it isn’t unheard of for travellers to end up at the wrong village entirely because of communication problems.

            <h3>HIKING IN XīSHUāNGBǎNNà</h3>
            <span class="anchor" id="ref-e449e86e4d11cf7511b9616c5c260b85"/>
              <p class="box-flush-left">Hikes around Xīshuāngbǎnnà used to be among the best in China – you’d be invited into a local’s home to eat, sleep and drink <em>mǐjiǔ</em> (rice wine). Growing numbers of visitors have changed this in many places, while encroaching rubber and banana plantations – some wags now refer to the region as Xīshuāngbanana – are having an increasingly deleterious effect on the environment.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">It's still possible to find villages that see very few foreigners and remain pristine, but they are remote. Don't expect to roll up in Jǐnghóng and the next day to be in a village that hasn't seen a Westerner before. And don't automatically expect a welcome mat and a free lunch because you’re a foreigner.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">If you do get invited into someone’s home, try and establish whether payment is expected. If it’s not, leave an offering or modest gift (ask at the backpacker cafes to find out what’s considered appropriate), even though the family may insist on nothing.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">Also take care before heading off. It’s a jungle out there, so go prepared, and make sure somebody knows where you are and when you should return. In the rainy season, you’ll need to be equipped with proper hiking shoes and waterproof gear. At any time you’ll need water purification tablets, bottled water or a water bottle able to hold boiled water, as well as snacks and sunscreen.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">Seriously consider taking a guide. You won’t hear much Mandarin on the trail, let alone any English. Expect to pay around ¥300 per day.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">Both the <a href="ebook-35-yunnan-chi15b.xhtml#ref-24664c3c590c92f18069066947659c9c">Mekong Café</a> and the <a href="ebook-35-yunnan-chi15b.xhtml#ref-f8805f100860e83ff61b381a97895394">Bǎnnà Cafe</a> in Jǐnghóng can arrange treks and guides.

But it's still a drowsy place and, a couple of pagodas apart, is really just a staging point for hikes to the surrounding minority villages. Bear in mind that rubber plantations have made the countryside here less pristine than it once was.</p>

                  <p class="flush-left">Surrounded by jungle (watch out for stray snakes!), this pagoda dates back to 1204 and is Dàměnglóng’s premier attraction. According to legend, the pagoda’s temple was built on the location of a hallowed footprint left behind by the Sakyamuni Buddha, who is said to have visited Xīshuāngbǎnnà. If you have an interest in ancient footprints you can look for it in a niche below one of the nine stupas. The temple has been extensively renovated in recent years.</p>
                
                
                  <p class="body-text">If you’re in the area in late October or early November, check the precise dates of the Dǎn Tǎ Festival. At this time, White Bamboo Shoot Pagoda is host to hundreds of locals whose celebrations include dancing, rockets and fireworks, paper balloons and so on.</p>
                  <p class="body-text">The pagoda is easy to get to: just walk back along the main road towards Jǐnghóng for 2km until you reach a small village with a temple on your left. From here there’s a path up the hill, it’s about a 20-minute walk. A motor-rickshaw from Dàměnglóng is ¥10.</p>

The pagoda itself is actually gold, not black. Take a stroll up and have a chat with the few monks in residence. The views of Dàměnglóng and surrounding countryside are more interesting than the temple itself.</p>

              <p class="box-body-text">Apart from the one bus from Měnglà to Luang Nam Tha in Laos, a daily bus also runs to Luang Nam Tha from Jǐnghóng (¥70, seven hours, 10.40am). Along with the daily bus to Vientiane from Kūnmíng (¥587, 30 hours, 6.30pm), it stops at Měnglà, but you’re not guaranteed a seat.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">No matter what anyone says, there should be no ‘charge’ to cross. Once your passport is stamped (double-check all stamps), you can jump on a motor-rickshaw to take you 3km into Laos for around ¥5. Whatever you do, go early – in case things wrap up early on either side. There are guesthouses on both the Chinese and Laos sides; people generally change money on the Laos side.</p>
