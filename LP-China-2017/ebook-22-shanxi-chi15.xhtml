        <h3>Why Go?</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Waist-deep in handsome history, Shānxī (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">山西</span></span>) is home to an impressive roll-call of must-see, ancient sights. Most travellers start with the walled city of Píngyáo. Basing yourself here and jumping to the town's surrounding sights is practically all you need: you'll encounter time-worn temples, traditional Qing dynasty courtyard architecture, some of the warmest people in the Middle Kingdom and the opportunity for a day trip to the dizzying mountain cliffs and gorges of Mián Shān.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Travellers shouldn't overlook Dàtóng, a forward-thinking city with a brand-new city wall and a great-looking old town, but it's the astonishing cave sculptures at Yúngāng outside town that give expression to the province's other great source of magic: a rich vein of Buddhist heritage, which splendidly litters the rolling mountain vastness of Wǔtái Shān with temples. Add the still-inhabited cave dwellings of Lǐjiā Shān and vestiges of the Great Wall, and you could find yourself staying longer than planned.</p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Though home to the powerful state of Jin, which split into three in 403 BC, Shānxī really only rose to greatness with the Tuoba, a clan of the Xianbei people from Mongolia and Manchuria who made Dàtóng their capital during the Northern Wei (AD 386–534). Eventually the Tuoba were assimilated, but as China weakened following the Tang collapse, the northern invaders returned; most notable were the Khitan (907–1125), whose western capital was also in Dàtóng.</p>
        <p class="body-text">After the Ming regained control of northern China, Shānxī was developed as a defensive outpost, with an inner and outer Great Wall constructed along the northern boundaries. Local merchants took advantage of the increased stability to trade, eventually transforming the province into the country’s financial centre with the creation of China’s first banks in Píngyáo.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Today Shānxī is best known for its many mines; the province contains one-third of all China’s coal deposits and parts of it are heavily polluted, while Dàtóng has experienced an astonishing, if controversial, facelift.</p>

        <p class="info-flush-left">There are airports at Dàtóng and Tàiyuán, with flights to cities across China. Tàiyuán and Píngyáo are connected to Běijīng and other cities by high-speed rail, while long-distance buses run to neighbouring provinces and further afield.</p>
      
      
        <p class="info-flush-left">Modern railway lines and roads split Shānxī on a northeast–southwest axis, so getting between Dàtóng, Tàiyuán and Píngyáo is no problem, with long-distance buses taking up the slack.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">Dàtóng today is fascinating, and charming to boot. Come night-time, the old-town sensations – with red lanterns swinging in the breeze and wind chimes tinkling on the illuminated city walls – are hard to beat. Most of this has been re-created from scratch by an overambitious mayor: a mountain of cash – an estimated ¥50 billion – has been ploughed into a colossal renovation of the old quarter. The city wall has been rebuilt in its entirety (well, almost) and the city has shown how it can cut it with other drawcard cities such as Hángzhōu and Xī'ān. What's more, the town is the gateway to the awe-inspiring Yúngāng Caves, one of China’s most outstanding Buddhist treasures. Dàtóng is also a launchpad to the photogenic Hanging Monastery, the world’s oldest wooden pagoda, crumbling earthen sections of the Great Wall and onward trips to sacred Wǔtái Shān.</p>

      <div class="history">
        <h3>History</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Dàtóng has long held a strategic position on the edge of the Mongolian grasslands, first rising to greatness as the capital of the Tuoba. A federation of Turkic-speaking nomads who united northern China (AD 386–534) and converted to Buddhism, the Tuoba were eventually assimilated into Chinese culture (like most other invaders). The Tuoba established the Northern Wei dynasty, whose greatest achievement here was the Yúngāng Caves, a collection of sublime 5th-century Buddhist carvings that capture a quiet, timeless and evocative beauty. The dynastic capital was later moved to Luòyáng in Hénán province and the rock carving continued at the astonishing Lóngmén Grottoes.</p>

              <p class="flush-left">Dàtóng’s old town has been massively resurrected at colossal expense to put Dàtóng back on the map. The former mayor – now Tàiyuán's mayor – ploughed a fortune into trying to turn Dàtóng back into an old town (by rebuilding it). Sadly, and typical in China, a considerable amount of the original old town was levelled before being rebuilt. Nonetheless, what is on show is alluring, especially at night when lanterns delightfully illuminate the old town.</p>

Prior to the rebuild, the wall had been denuded of bricks and reduced to earthen stumps. At present, you can only walk around three sides of the wall – the gate in the west is still under construction. The wall is not the original, but looks sublime.</p>

Under construction since 2011, all that survives of the original palace is the Nine Dragon Screen. The palace was still undergoing construction at the time of writing.</p>

Built in 1891, the church was burned down on 13 July 1900 during the xenophobic and anti-Christian Boxer Rebellion, taking a few Catholics with it; it was rebuilt in 1906. Both bell towers were destroyed in 1966 during the Cultural Revolution, but the house of worship was repaired in 1982 and 2006.</p>

              <p class="flush-left">One of China’s most supreme examples of Buddhist cave art, these 5th-century caves are simply magnificent. With 51,000 ancient statues and celestial beings, they put virtually everything else in the Shānxī shade. Carved by the Turkic-speaking Tuoba, the Yúngāng Caves drew their designs from Indian, Persian and even Greek influences that swept along the Silk Road. Work began in AD 460, continuing for 60 years before all 252 caves, the oldest collection of Buddhist carvings in China, had been completed.</p>
            
            
              <p class="body-text">Pass through the slick visitors centre and a re-created temple on a lake before arriving at the caves. You may find some caves shut for restoration and this is done on a rotational basis; at the time of writing Caves 11 to 13 were closed to visitors. That still leaves around 40 showcasing some of the most precious and elegant Buddhist artwork in China. Despite weathering, many of the statues at Yúngāng still retain their gorgeous pigment, unlike the slightly more recent statues at Lóngmén in Hénán. The caves that are deeply recessed, in particular, have been well protected from the outside weather, although the penetration of water from above is a constant hazard.</p>
              <p class="body-text">A number of caves were once covered by wooden structures. Many of these are long gone, although the very impressive Caves 5 to 13 are still fronted by recently constructed wooden temples.</p>
              <p class="body-text">Some caves contain intricately carved square-shaped pagodas or central columns which you can circumambulate, while others depict the inside of temples, carved and painted to look as though they're made of wood. Frescoes are in abundance and there are graceful depictions of animals, birds and angels, some still brightly painted, and almost every cave contains the 1000-Buddha motif (tiny Buddhas seated in niches).</p>
              <p class="body-text">Eight of the caves contain enormous Buddha statues; the largest can be found in Cave 5, an outstanding 17m-high, seated effigy of Sakyamuni with a gilded face. As with many here, the frescoes in this cave are badly scratched and vandalised, but note the painted vaulted ceiling. Bursting with colour, Cave 6, the Cave of Sakyamuni, is also stunning, resembling an overblown set from an <em>Indiana Jones</em> epic with legions of Buddhist angels, Bodhisattvas and other celestial figures. In the middle of the cave, a square block pagoda or column fuses with the ceiling, with Buddhas on each side across two levels. Most foreign visitors are oblivious to the graffiti in bright red oil paint on the right-hand side of the main door frame within the cave, which reads <span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">大同八中 </span></span>(Dàtóng Bāzhōng; Datong No 8 Middle School), probably courtesy of pupils during the Cultural Revolution. The frescoes here are also badly scratched by recent visitors from the years of turmoil – the 40-year-old date '76.12.8' is etched crudely.</p>
              <p class="body-text">The dual chamber Cave 9, the Aksokhya Buddha Cave, is an astonishing spectacle too, with its vast seated and gold-faced Buddha.</p>
              <p class="body-text">Caves 16 to 20 are the earliest caves at Yúngāng, carved under the supervision of monk Tanyao. Cave 16, the Standing Buddha Cave, contains a huge standing Buddha whose middle section is badly eroded. The walls of the cave are perforated with small niches containing Buddhas. Cave 17 houses a colossal 15.6m seated Maitreya Buddha, badly weathered, but intact. Examine the exceptional quality of the carvings in Cave 18; some of the faces are perfectly presented. Cave 19 contains a vast 16.8m-high effigy of Sakyamuni.</p>
              <p class="body-text">Entirely exposed to the elements, Cave 20 (AD460–470) is similar to the Losana Buddha Statue Cave at <a href="ebook-25-henan-chi15.xhtml#ref-b5bbcfc447ebf4a366b7f25a6f108254">Lóngmén</a>, originally depicting a trinity of Buddhas (the past, present and future Buddhas). The huge seated Buddha in the middle is the representative icon at Yúngāng, while the Buddha on the left has somehow vanished. Prayer mats are arrayed out front so that pilgrims can worship.</p>
              <p class="body-text">Some effigies, such as in Cave 39, have had their heads crudely bludgeoned off. Past the last set of caves, you can turn off the path down to the slick and highly informative <strong>museum</strong> (9.30am-5pm) detailing the Wei Kingdom and the artwork at the caves. Sadly, English captions are very limited.</p>
              <p class="body-text">Most of the caves, however, come with good dual Chinese/English captions. English-speaking tour guides can be hired for ¥150; their services include a trip to the museum. Note that photography is permitted in some caves but not in others.</p>
              <p class="body-text">To get to the caves, take bus 603 (¥3, 45 minutes) from Dàtóng train station to the terminus. Buses run every 10 to 15 minutes. A taxi from Dàtóng is around ¥40 each way. You will pass the rather less appealing Dàtóng Coal Mine en route.</p>

All that remains of the <strong>Holy Mother Church</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">圣母堂; </span></span>Shèngmǔ Táng), built in 1876, is its front gate and bell tower and lopped-off spire above it.

Expect to pay between ¥80 and ¥100 return; the driver will wait for you for around 30 minutes.

              <p class="body-text">If you ask nicely (or cross the driver's palm with a bit more silver), the driver may take you up winding mountain roads to a <strong>scenic lookout</strong> on top of Mótiān Lǐng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">摩天岭</span></span>), on the road to Liángchéng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">凉城</span></span>), where you can get an elevated perspective down onto the earthen Great Wall trailing off into the distance.</p>

Some of the more popular temples charge an additional small entrance fee. On the way in, the bus will stop at a large visitors centre where you buy tickets and reboard after your tickets are checked.

Roads lead to the summits of the five main peaks, so you can take a taxi up to one of them before hiking back into town using the road as a bearing. Minibuses run to all five peaks for ¥350 (7.30am departure, return 5pm). They can be found at the big car park by the chairlift to Dàiluó Peak.</p>

              <p class="box-flush-left">This 18th-century complex of courtyards is one of the finest remaining examples of a traditional private residence in all of China. Once home to a celebrated merchant, it’s an austere (yet compelling) maze of doorways and courtyards that lead onto a seemingly infinite number of rooms (more than 300). The complex is famous in China as the set of Zhang Yimou’s beautiful, required-viewing Fifth Generation tragedy <em>Raise the Red Lantern</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">大红灯笼高高挂; </span></span><em>Dàhóng Dēnglóng Gāogāo Guā</em>).</p>
            
            
              <p class="box-flush-left">If you have seen the film and enjoyed it, a visit is a must. Sure enough, the place is festooned with red lanterns; but many fascinating exhibits of Qing-era furniture and clothes are also displayed, as well as Shānxī opera costumes and props. English signage helps convey northern Chinese traditions and rites to foreign visitors.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">The site is massively popular with domestic tour groups so get here as early as you can to steal a lead on the colour-coordinated baseball-hatted tour groups from across China. While the entrance is glossed up, and souvenir and food stalls besiege the courtyard, the residence is still big enough to flee the crowds: step through one of the many doorways and they magically vanish.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">To get here, catch any bus going to Qíxiàn (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">祁县; </span></span>¥23, 1½ hours) from Tàiyuán’s Jiànnán bus station. Tell the driver where you’re headed and they’ll drop you at the main gate. You can also visit from Píngyáo (¥13, 45 minutes, every 30 minutes to 6.40pm).</p>

          <p class="flush-left">Píngyáo is China’s best-preserved ancient walled town. If you have any China mileage under your belt you'll appreciate the town’s age-old charms; charms squandered away – or forever lost – elsewhere across the Middle Kingdom. While other ‘ancient’ cities in China will rustle together an unconvincing display of old city walls, sporadic temples or the occasional ragged alley thrust beneath an unsightly melange of white-tile architecture and greying apartment blocks, Píngyáo has managed to keep its beguiling narrative largely intact: red-lantern-hung lanes set against night-time silhouettes of imposing town walls, elegant courtyard architecture, ancient towers poking into the north China sky, and an entire brood of creaking temples and old buildings.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Píngyáo is also a living and breathing community where the 30,000-odd locals who reside in the old town hang laundry in courtyards, career down alleyways on bicycles, sun themselves in doorways or chew the fat with neighbours.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div class="history">
        <h3>History</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Already a thriving merchant town during the Ming dynasty, Píngyáo’s ascendancy arrived in the Qing era when merchants created the country’s first banks along with cheques to facilitate the transfer of silver from one place to another. The city escaped the shocking reshaping much loved by communist town planners, and almost 4000 Ming- and Qing-dynasty residences remain within the city walls.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Even as late as the early 1990s, foreign visitors would come to Píngyáo, but they'd stay in a hotel outside the walls and only visit the more famous Shuānglín Temple, 7km away. Then they would return to Běijīng or proceed to Xī'ān. Gradually the occasional <em>lǎowài</em> (foreigner) crept through the gates and discovered the amazingly well-preserved town hiding behind it. The rest is history.</p>

You will always find something new, whether it's an ancient temple or alleyway, or an old courtyard house. It’s free to walk the streets, but you must pay ¥150 to climb the city walls or enter any of the 18 buildings deemed historically significant. Tickets are valid for three days and can be purchased from near the gate openings and at other ticket offices near the big sights. Opening hours for sights are 8am to 7pm in summer and 8am to 6pm in winter.</p>

            <p class="flush-left">With vertiginous and dizzying cliffs alongside a deep gorge, this astonishing mountain area is a splendid day trip from Píngyáo. Lined with precariously perched temple architecture, scenic gully walks and breathtaking views, the road snaking around the mountain is an undemanding hike, with buses linking the main sights. From the bus drop-off, it's a short walk to <strong>Dragon Head Temple</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">龙头寺; </span></span>Lóngtóu Sì), from where a long, flat road links to the <strong>Shuǐtāogōu Scenic Area</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">水涛沟景区; </span></span>Shuǐtāogōu Jǐngqū), a few hours' walk.</p>
          
          
            <p class="body-text">From Dragon Head Temple, the wide road (which accommodates the hop-on, hop-off buses that rattle along the route) hugs the side of the mountain, overlooking a deep and perilous drop into the gorge below. The distant sound of the river at the bottom accompanies you as you hike, with vertical cliffs on either side. You will pass a spring and then the <strong>Dàluó Temple</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">大罗宫; </span></span>Dàluō Gōng), built up the side of the cliff. Winding around the mountain with a stomach-wrenching view below your feet is <strong>Rabbit Bridge</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">兔桥; </span></span>Tùqiáo). It was out of bounds at the time of writing, so you needed to walk through the tunnel. Ahead is <strong>Yúnfēng Temple</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">云峰寺; </span></span>Yúnfēng Sì) and the <strong>Sky Ladder</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">天桥; </span></span>Tiānqiáo), a scary-looking walkway climbing up the side of the mountain. Past <strong>Five Dragon Peak</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">无龙峰; </span></span>Wǔlóng Fēng) is the exhilarating <strong>Qīxián Gǔ</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">栖贤谷</span></span>), a lovely river-gorge walk. Beyond lie the waterfalls, bridges and water-curtain caves of the Shuǐtāogōu Scenic Area.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Buses run regularly between the sights, so just hop-on and hop-off, although walking between the different areas is not difficult. The first/last bus up the mountain from the ticket office is at 7am/7pm. You must buy the bus ticket (¥50) as you cannot walk up from the main ticket office and the ticket entitles you to free transport between the sights. Pick up a map at the ticket office for ¥5. Take water, sunscreen and, if travelling in the colder months, some warm clothes.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Take a train (¥7 to ¥9, 25 minutes, regular) to Jièxiū (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">介休</span></span>) from Píngyáo train station or take a bus (¥11, one hour) from Píngyáo bus station to Jièxiū bus station. Buses (¥10) to Mián Shān leave from in front of the train station, around 300m east along Xinjian Xilu (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">新建西路</span></span>) from the long-distance bus station in Jièxiū. Booking a car from Píngyáo would cost around ¥300 for the return trip; this can be arranged at hotels such as the <a href="ebook-22-shanxi-chi15.xhtml#ref-77cf75eaec081721dba4d83ae44cf884">Harmony Guesthouse</a>.</p>

Housed within its time-worn timbers is a collection of 11 10th-century painted sculptures and frescoes.</p>
          
          
            <p class="body-text">At the rear of the hall a Guanyin sits <em>lalitasana</em> (a lithe and very relaxed regal posture).

People here speak Jin, although most understand Mandarin.</p>
              <p class="body-text">To get here, cross the bridge by Qìkǒu’s bus stop and follow the river for about 30 minutes until you see a blue sign indicating Lǐjiā Shān. Walk on for about 100m and then take the road up the hill for another 30 minutes and you’ll reach the old village. Local cars do a return run for around ¥50 to ¥60. If you're planning on staying, you'll need to negotiate a rate or walk out.</p>

Sadly, the stage is unused today. You can't miss the temple: from Qìkǒu’s main road, head up any number of old cobbled pathways up the hill, via the odd courtyard or two.</p>
