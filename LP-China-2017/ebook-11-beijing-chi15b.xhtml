The interior is magnificent, coloured in red, green and gold, and decked out with tables and a stone floor, while balconies surround the canopied stage. Opposite the theatre, there’s a very small opera <strong>museum</strong> displaying operatic scores, old catalogues and other paraphernalia.</p>
          
          
            <p class="body-text">There are also colour illustrations of the <em>liǎnpǔ</em> (types of Peking-opera facial makeup) – examples include the <em>hóu liǎnpǔ</em> (monkey face) and the <em>chǒujué liǎnpǔ</em> (clown face). The theatre dates back to 1807 and, in 1912, was where the Kuomintang (KMT), led by Dr Sun Yatsen, was founded. Shows here attract a lot of domestic tour groups. There are few English captions, but it's not hard to follow what's going on.</p>
            <p class="body-text">The restaurant here is also very good, and inexpensive, making for a nice pre- or post-theatre meal.</p>

It can be a pleasant place to shop for souvenirs, but avoid summer weekends when the shopping frenzy reaches fever pitch and you can hardly walk down the street for the crowds. At its northern end, Gulou Dongdajie has for a while now been a popular place for young Beijingers to shop for vintage clothing, skater fashion and music gear.</p>

The serious collectors are early birds, swooping here at dawn to snare precious relics. If you want to join them, an early start is essential. You probably aren't going to find that rare Qianlong <em>dòucǎi</em> stem cup or late Yuan dynasty <em>qīnghuā</em> vase, but what’s on view is still a compendium of post-1950 Chinese curios and an A to Z of Middle Kingdom knick-knacks. The market is chaotic and can be difficult if you find crowds or hard bargaining intimidating. Ignore the ‘don’t pay more than half’ rule here – some vendors might start at 10 times the real price. Make a few rounds to compare prices and weigh it up before forking out for something.</p>
              <p class="body-text">To get here, come out of exit B at Panjiayuan subway station, then walk west for 200m to find the main entrance to the market.</p>

          <p class="info-flush-left">The Chinese have a deep and uncomplicated love of children and openly display their affection for them. Běijīng may have less child-friendly facilities than equivalent-sized cities in the West, but the locals will go out of their way to accommodate your kids.</p>

        <p class="info-heading-2">Travellers with Disabilities</p>
        
          <p class="info-flush-left">If you are wheelchair-bound or have a mobility disability, Běijīng can be a major obstacle course. Pavements are often crowded and in a dangerous condition, with high curbs often preventing wheelchair access. Many streets can be crossed only via underground or overhead walkways with steps. You will also have to stick to the main roads, as parked cars and bicycles often occupy the pavements of smaller alleys and lanes, forcing others on to the road. Escalators in subways normally only go up, but wheelchair lifts have been installed in numerous stations (although you may have to send someone down to find a member of staff to operate them). Getting around temples and big sights such as the Forbidden City and the Summer Palace can be trying for those in wheelchairs. It is recommended that you take a lightweight chair so it can be collapsed easily when necessary, such as to load it into the back of a taxi. Most, but not all, hotels will have lifts, and while many top-end hotels do have rooms for those with disabilities as well as good wheelchair access, hotel restaurants may not.</p>
          <p class="info-body-text">Those with sight, hearing or mobility disabilities must be extremely cautious of the traffic, which almost never yields to pedestrians.</p>

Note that when swiping your card, don't remove it until you hear a click. Bike use is free for the first hour, so if you use them cleverly, swapping bikes at another kiosk before your hour is up, it means free bikes. After the first hour, it's ¥1 per hour to begin with, before it starts rising in price to ¥2, ¥3 or ¥4 per hour, depending on how long you keep the bike for.</p>

Nevertheless, it’s still a challenge to get from A to B successfully, and the buses are as packed as ever, so you rarely see foreigners climbing aboard.</p>

          <p class="info-flush-left">China does not recognise the International Driving Permit, but it is relatively straightforward to obtain a temporary driving licence that allows you to drive in Běijīng and the surrounding area. The Vehicle Administration Office at Terminal 3 at Běijīng Capital International Airport issues temporary licences, and you can also rent cars at Terminal 3 and other locations around town from Hertz.</p>
          <p class="info-body-text">A separate licence is needed to drive a motorbike and it is generally not possible to rent motorbikes in Běijīng as the capital, like many Chinese cities, has restrictions on where motorbikes can be driven. No licence is required to drive a scooter, or electric bike, but they are not normally available for hire. Given the relatively low cost of hiring a car with a driver, or a taxi for the day, few visitors self-drive.</p>

The backdrop is lovely: terraced orchards and fields with ancient houses and alleyways rising up the hillside and temples in the surrounding area. Two hours is more than enough to wander around the village because it’s not big, but staying the night allows you to soak up its historic charms without the distraction of all those day trippers.</p>

            <p class="flush-left">The main attractions in Chuāndǐxià are the <strong>courtyard homes</strong> and the cobbled steps and alleyways that link them up. Great fun can be had just wandering the village and poking your head into whichever ancient doorways take your fancy. Most of the homes date from the Qing dynasty, although a few remain from Ming times. Many have been turned into small restaurants or guesthouses, meaning you can eat, drink tea or even stay the night in a 500-year-old Chinese courtyard.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Chuāndǐxià is also a museum of <strong>Maoist slogans</strong>, especially up the incline among the better-preserved houses. Look for the very clear, red-painted slogan just past the Landlord’s Courtyard (the village’s principal courtyard), which reads: <span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑 </span></span>(<em>yòng</em> <em>Máozédōng</em> <em>sīxiǎng wǔzhuāng wǒmen de tóunǎo</em>; use Mao Zedong thought to arm our minds).</p>

            <p class="flush-left">More than half the houses in Chuāndǐxià are now guesthouses, so finding a place to sleep isn't a problem (although very few stay open in winter, when the mercury plummets). All the inns can be identified by English signs, even if their owners rarely speak any English. All serve meals too.</p>
          
          
            <p class="body-text">Signs are clearly labelled in English, so places are easy to spot. Your best bet is to simply wander round and find what best suits you. Most restaurants have English menus. Specialities here include walnuts, apricots and roast leg of lamb.</p>
