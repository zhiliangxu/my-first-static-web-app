    <div class="introduction">
      
        <div class="introduction"><p class="intro">China is custodian of one of the world’s richest cultural and artistic legacies. Until the 20th century, China’s arts were deeply conservative and resistant to change but revolutions in technique and content over the last century fashioned a dramatic transformation. Despite this evolution, China’s arts – whatever the period – embrace a common aesthetic that embodies the very soul and lifeblood of the nation.</p></div>
      
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
      
        <p class="flush-left">In reflection of the Chinese character, Chinese aesthetics have traditionally been marked by restraint and understatement, a preference for oblique references over direct explanation, vagueness in place of specificity and an avoidance of the obvious in place of a fondness for the veiled and subtle. Traditional Chinese aesthetics sought to cultivate a more reserved artistic impulse, principles that compellingly find their way into virtually every Chinese art form, from painting to sculpture, ceramics, calligraphy, film, poetry, literature and beyond.</p>
        <p class="body-text">As one of the central strands of the world’s oldest civilisation, China’s aesthetic traditions are tightly woven into Chinese cultural identity. For millennia, Chinese aesthetics were highly traditionalist and, despite coming under the influence of occupiers from the Mongols to the Europeans, defiantly conservative. It was not until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911 and the appearance of the New Culture Movement that China’s great artistic traditions began to rapidly transform. In literature the stranglehold of classical Chinese loosened to allow breathing space for <em>báihuà</em> (colloquial Chinese) and a progressive new aesthetic started to flower, ultimately leading to revolutions in all of the arts, from poetry to painting, theatre and music.</p>
        <p class="body-text">It is hard to square China’s great aesthetic traditions with the devastation inflicted upon them since 1949. Confucius advocated the edifying role of music and poetry in shaping human lives, but 5th-century philosopher Mozi was less enamoured with them, seeing music and other arts as extravagant and wasteful. The communists took this a stage further, enlisting the arts as props in their propaganda campaigns, and permitting the vandalism and destruction of much traditional architecture and heritage. Many of China’s traditional skills (such as martial arts lineages) and crafts either died out or went into decline during the Cultural Revolution. Many of the arts have yet to recover fully from this deterioration, even though opening up and reform prompted a vast influx of foreign artistic concepts.</p>

          <p class="sidebar">The five fundamental brushstrokes necessary to master calligraphy can be found in the character <span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">永</span></span>, which means eternal or forever.</p>
        
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Calligraphy</h2>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Although calligraphy (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">书法; </span></span><em>shūfǎ</em>) has a place among most languages that employ alphabets, the art of calligraphy in China is taken to unusual heights of intricacy and beauty in a language that is alphabet-free and essentially composed of images.</p>
        <p class="body-text">To fully appreciate how perfectly suited written Chinese is for calligraphy, it is vital to grasp how written Chinese works. A word in English represents a sound alone; a written character in Chinese combines both sound and a picture. Indeed, the sound element of a Chinese character – when present – is often auxiliary to the illustration of a visual image, even if that image is abstract.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Furthermore, although some Chinese characters were simplified in the 1950s as part of a literacy drive, most characters have remained unchanged for thousands of years. As characters are essentially images, they inadequately reflect changes in spoken Chinese over time. A phonetic written language such as English can alter over the centuries to reflect changes in the sound of the language (so the written language changes). Being pictographic, Chinese cannot easily do this, so while the spoken language has transformed over the centuries, the written language has remained more static. Indeed, any changes to traditional written Chinese characters would result in changes to the pronunciation of how they are read.</p>
        <p class="body-text">This helps explain why Chinese calligraphy is the trickiest of China’s arts to comprehend for Western visitors, unless they have a sound understanding of written Chinese. The beauty of a Chinese character may be partially appreciated by a Western audience, but for a full understanding it is also essential to understand the meaning of the character (or characters).</p>
        <p class="body-text">There are five main calligraphic scripts – seal script, clerical script, semicursive script, cursive script and standard script – each of which reflects the style of writing of a specific era. Seal script, the oldest and most complex, was the official writing system during the Qin dynasty and has been employed ever since in the carving of the seals and name chops (stamps carved from stone) that are used to stamp documents. Expert calligraphers have a preference for using full-form characters <em>(fántǐzì)</em> rather than their simplified variants <em>(jiǎntǐzì)</em>.</p>

          <p class="sidebar">Chinese individuals and companies are also purchasing non-Chinese art masterpieces. In 2015 Claude Monet’s <em>Bassin aux nymphéas, les rosiers</em> sold for $20.4m at auction to the Dalian Wanda Group.</p>

      <h2>Painting</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Traditional Painting</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Unlike Chinese calligraphy, no ‘insider’ knowledge is required for a full appreciation of traditional Chinese painting. Despite its symbolism, obscure references and occasionally abstruse philosophical allusions, Chinese painting is highly accessible. For this reason, traditional Chinese paintings – especially landscapes – have long been treasured in the West for their beauty.</p>
          <p class="body-text">As described in Xie He’s 6th-century-AD treatise, the <em>Six Principles of Painting,</em> the chief aim of Chinese painting is to capture the innate essence or spirit <em>(qì)</em> of a subject and endow it with vitality. The brush line, varying in thickness and tone, was the second principle (referred to as the ‘bone method’) and is the defining technique of Chinese painting. Traditionally, it was imagined that brushwork quality could reveal the artist’s moral character. As a general rule, painters were less concerned with achieving outward resemblance (that was the third principle) than with conveying intrinsic qualities.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Early painters dwelled on the human figure and moral teachings, while also conjuring up scenes from everyday life. By the time of the Tang dynasty, a new genre, known as landscape painting, had begun to flower. Reaching full bloom during the Song and Yuan dynasties, landscape painting meditated on the surrounding environment. Towering mountains, ethereal mists, open spaces, trees and rivers, and light and dark were all exquisitely presented in ink washes on silk. Landscape paintings attempted to capture the metaphysical and the absolute, drawing the viewer into a particular realm where the philosophies of Taoism and Buddhism found expression. Humanity is typically a small and almost insignificant subtext to the performance. The dreamlike painting sought to draw the viewer in rather than impose itself on them.</p>
          <p class="body-text">On a technical level, the success of landscapes depended on the artists’ skill in capturing light and atmosphere. Blank, open spaces devoid of colour create light-filled voids, contrasting with the darkness of mountain folds and forests, filling the painting with <em>qì</em> and vaporous vitality. Specific emotions are not aroused but instead nebulous sensations permeate. Painting and classical poetry often went hand in hand, best exemplified by the work of Tang-dynasty poet/artist Wang Wei (699–759).</p>
        
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar">
        
          <p class="sidebar">The most abstract calligraphic form is grass or cursive script <em>(cǎoshū),</em> a highly fluid style of penmanship which even Chinese people have difficulty reading.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Modern Art</h3>
        <div>
          <h4>Socialist Realism</h4>
          
            <p class="flush-left">After 1949, classical Chinese techniques were abandoned and foreign artistic techniques imported wholesale. Washes on silk were replaced with oil on canvas and China’s traditional obsession with the mysterious and ineffable made way for concrete attention to detail and realism.</p>
            <p class="body-text">By 1970 Chinese artists had aspired to master the skills of socialist realism, a vibrant communist-endorsed style that drew from European neoclassical art, the lifelike canvases of Jacques-Louis David and the output of Soviet Union painters. The style had virtually nothing to do with traditional Chinese painting techniques. Saturated with political symbolism and propaganda, the blunt artistic style was manufactured on an industrial scale (and frequently on industrial themes).</p>
            <p class="body-text">The entire trajectory of Chinese painting – which had evolved in glacial increments over the centuries – had been redirected virtually overnight. Vaporous landscapes were substituted with hard-edged panoramas. Traditional Taoist and Buddhist philosophy was overturned and humans became the master of nature and often the most dominant theme. Dreamy vistas were out; smoke stacks, red tractors and muscled peasants were in.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Propaganda Art</h4>
          
            <p class="flush-left">Another art form that found a fertile environment during the Mao era was the propaganda poster. Mass-produced from the 1950s onwards and replicated in their thousands through tourist markets across China today, the colourful Chinese propaganda poster was a further instrument of social control in a nation where aesthetics had become subservient to communist orthodoxy.</p>
            <p class="body-text">With a prolific range of themes from chubby, well-fed Chinese babies to the Korean War, the virtues of physical education, the suppression of counter-revolutionary activity and paeans to the achievements of the Great Leap Forward or China as an earthly paradise, propaganda posters were ubiquitous. The golden age of poster production ran through to the 1980s, only declining during Deng Xiaoping’s tenure and the opening up of China to the West.</p>
            <p class="body-text">The success of visual propaganda lay in its appeal to a large body of illiterate or semiliterate peasants. The idealism, revolutionary romanticism and vivid colouring of Chinese propaganda art brought hope and vibrancy to a time that was actually often colourless and drab, while adding certainty to an era of great hardship and struggle.</p>
          
          <div class="sidebar">
            
              <p class="sidebar">In 2011 an ink and brush painting by artist Qi Baishi (1864–1957) sold for ¥425 million (US$65 million) at auction.</p>
            
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Post-Mao</h4>
          
            <p class="flush-left">It was only with the death of Mao Zedong in September 1976 that the shadow of the Cultural Revolution – when Chinese aesthetics were conditioned by the threat of violence – began its retreat and the individual artistic temperament was allowed to thrive afresh.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Painters such as Luo Zhongli employed the realist techniques gleaned from China’s art academies to depict the harsh realities etched in the faces of contemporary peasants. Others escaped the suffocating confines of socialist realism to navigate new horizons. A voracious appetite for Western art brought with it fresh concepts and ideas, while the ambiguity of precise meaning in the fine arts offered a degree of protection from state censors.</p>
            <p class="body-text">One group of artists, the Stars, found retrospective inspiration in Picasso and German Expressionism. The ephemeral group had a lasting impact on the development of Chinese art in the 1980s and 1990s, paving the way for the New Wave movement that emerged in 1985. New Wave artists were greatly influenced by Western art, especially the iconoclastic Marcel Duchamp. In true nihilist style, the New Wave artist Huang Yongping destroyed his works at exhibitions, in an effort to escape from the notion of ‘art’. Political realities became instant subject matter as performance artists wrapped themselves in plastic or tape to symbolise the repressive realities of modern-day China.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Beyond Tiān’ānmén</h4>
          
            <p class="flush-left">The Tiān’ānmén Square protests in 1989 fostered a deep-seated cynicism that permeated artworks with loss, loneliness and social isolation. An exodus of artists to the West commenced. This period also coincided with an upsurge in the art market as investors increasingly turned to artworks and money began to slosh about.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Much post-1989 Chinese art dwelled obsessively on contemporary socioeconomic realities, with consumer culture, materialism, urbanisation and social change a repetitive focus. More universal themes became apparent, however, as the art scene matured. Meanwhile, many artists who left China in the 1990s have returned, setting up private studios and galleries. Government censorship remains, but artists are branching out into other areas and moving away from overtly political content and China-specific concerns.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Cynical realists Fang Lijun and Yue Minjun fashioned grotesque portraits that conveyed hollowness and mock joviality, tinged with despair. Born in the late 1950s, Wang Guangyi took pop art as a template for his ironic pieces, fused with propaganda art techniques from the Cultural Revolution.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Born just before the Cultural Revolution in 1964 and heavily influenced by German expressionism, Zeng Fanzhi explored the notions of alienation and isolation – themes commonly explored by Chinese artists during this period – in his <em>Mask</em> series from the 1990s. Introspection is a hallmark of Zeng’s oeuvre. In 2008 Christie’s in Hong Kong sold Zeng Fanzhi’s painting <em>Mask Series 1996 No. 6</em> (featuring masked members of China’s communist youth organisation, the Young Pioneers) for US$9.7 million, which is the highest price yet paid for a modern Chinese artwork.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Also born in the early 1960s, Zhang Dali is another artist who gave expression to social change and the gulf between rich and poor, especially the circumstances of the immigrant worker underclass in Běijīng.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Contemporary Directions</h4>
          
            <p class="flush-left">Most artists of note and aspiration gravitate to Běijīng (or Shànghǎi perhaps) to work. Today's China provides a huge wellspring of subject matter for artists, tempered by the reality of political censorship and the constraints of taboo. Themes that can seem tame in the West may assume a special power in China, so works can rely upon their context for potency and effect.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Ai Weiwei, who enjoys great international fame partly due to his disobedient stand, best exemplifies the dangerous overlap between artistic self-expression, dissent and conflict with the authorities. Arrested in 2011 and charged with tax evasion, Ai Weiwei gained further publicity for his temporary <em>Sunflower Seeds</em> exhibition at the Tate Modern in London.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Working collaboratively as Birdhead, Shànghǎi analogue photographers Ji Weiyu and Song Tao record the social dynamics and architectural habitat of their home city in thoughtful compositions. Běijīng-born Ma Qiusha works in video, photography, painting and installations on themes of a deeply personal nature. In her video work <em>From No.4 Pingyuanli to No.4 Tianqiaobeili</em>, the artist removes a bloody razor blade from her mouth after narrating her experiences as a young artist in China. Born in 1982, Ran Huang works largely in film but across a spectrum of media, conveying themes of absurdity, the irrational and conceptual. Shànghǎi artist Shi Zhiying explores ideas of a more traditional hue in her sublime oil-paint depictions on large canvases of landscapes and religious and cultural objects. Also from Shànghǎi, Xu Zhen works with provocative images to unsettle and challenge the viewer. Xu's <em>Fearless</em> (2012), a large mixed-media work on canvas, is a powerful maelstrom of symbolism and the fragments of cultural identity. Xīnjiāng-born Zhao Zhao – once an assistant to Ai Weiwei – communicates provocative sentiments in his work, exploring ideas of freedom and themes of a nonconformist nature.</p>

      <h2>Ceramics</h2>
      
        <p class="flush-left">China’s very first vessels – dating back more than 8000 years – were simple handcrafted earthenware pottery, primarily used for religious purposes. The invention of the pottery wheel during the late Neolithic period, however, led to a dramatic technological and artistic leap.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Over the centuries, Chinese potters perfected their craft, introducing many new and exciting styles and techniques. The spellbinding artwork of the Terracotta Warriors in Xī’ān reveals a highly developed level of technical skill achieved by Qin-dynasty craftsmen. Periods of artistic evolution, during the cosmopolitan Tang dynasty, for example, prompted further stylistic advances. The Tang dynasty ‘three-colour ware’ is a much-admired type of ceramic from this period, noted for its vivid yellow, green and white glaze. Demand for lovely blue-green celadons grew in countries as distant as Egypt and Persia.</p>
        <p class="body-text">The Yuan dynasty saw the first development of China’s standout ‘blue and white’ <em>(qīnghuā)</em> porcelain. Cobalt-blue paint from Persia was applied as an underglaze directly to white porcelain with a brush, the vessel then covered with another transparent glaze and fired. This technique was perfected during the Ming dynasty and such ceramics became hugely popular all over the world, eventually acquiring the name ‘China-ware’, whether produced in China or not.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Although many kilns were established in China, the most famous was at Jǐngdézhèn in Jiāngxī province, where royal porcelain was fired.</p>
        <p class="body-text">During the Qing dynasty, porcelain techniques were further refined and developed, showing superb craftsmanship and ingenuity. British and European consumers dominated the export market, displaying an insatiable appetite for Chinese vases and bowls decorated with flowers and landscapes. Stunning monochromatic ware is another hallmark of the Qing, especially the ox-blood vases, imperial yellow bowls and enamel-decorated porcelain. The Qing is also notable for its elaborate and highly decorative wares.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Jǐngdézhèn remains an excellent place to visit ceramic workshops and purchase various types of ceramic wares, from Mao statues to traditional glazed urns. The Shànghǎi Museum has a premier collection of porcelain, while several independent retailers in Běijīng, Shànghǎi and Hong Kong also sell more modish and creative pieces. <a href="ebook-20-shanghai-chi15b.xhtml#ref-d1c9d9c0cce02b71be88132bee0ef3eb">Spin</a>, in particular, sells a highly creative selection of contemporary ceramic designs.</p>
        <p class="body-text">In recent years wealthy Chinese collectors have embarked on a lavish spending spree, buying back China's ceramic heritage in the international auction markets, with staggering prices paid for pieces.</p>
      
      <div class="sidebar">
        
          <p class="sidebar">A dark and Gothic image in the West, the bat is commonly used in Chinese porcelain, wood designs, textiles and artwork as it is considered a good luck omen.</p>
        
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Sculpture</h2>
      
        <p class="flush-left">The earliest sculpture in China dates to the Zhou and Shang dynasties, when small clay and wooden figures were commonly placed in tombs to protect the dead and guide them on their way to heaven.</p>
        <p class="body-text">With the arrival of Buddhism, sculpture turned towards spiritual figures and themes, with sculptors frequently enrolled in huge carving projects for the worship of Sakyamuni. Influences also arrived along the Silk Road from abroad, bringing styles from as far afield as Greece and Persia, via India. The magnificent Buddhist caves at Yúngāng in Shānxī province, for example, date back to the 5th century and betray a noticeable Indian influence.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Chisellers also began work on the Lóngmén Grottoes in Hénán province at the end of the 5th century. The earliest effigies are similar in style to those at Yúngāng, revealing further Indian influences and an other-worldliness in their facial expressions. Later cave sculptures at Lóngmén were completed during the Tang dynasty and display a more Chinese style.</p>
        <p class="body-text">The most superlative examples are at the Mògāo Grottoes at Dūnhuáng in Gānsù province, where well-preserved Indian and Central Asian–style sculptures, particularly of the Tang dynasty, carry overtly Chinese characteristics – many statues feature long, fluid bodies and have warmer, more refined facial features.</p>
        <p class="body-text">The Shànghǎi Museum has a splendid collection of Buddhist sculpture, as does Capital Museum and the Poly Art Museum, both in Běijīng.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Beyond China’s grottoes, other mesmerising Chinese sculpture hides away in temples across China. The colossal statue of Guanyin in Pǔníng Temple in Chéngdé is a staggering sight, carved from five different types of wood and towering over 22m in height. Shuānglín Temple outside Píngyáo in Shānxī province is famed for its astonishing collection of painted statues from the Song and Yuan dynasties.</p>

        <h3>Classic Novels</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Until the early 20th century, classical literature (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">古文; </span></span><em>gǔwén</em>) had been the principal form of writing in China for thousands of years. A breed of purely literary writing, classical Chinese employed a stripped-down form of written Chinese that did not reflect the way people actually spoke or thought. Its grammar differed from the syntax of spoken Chinese and it employed numerous obscure Chinese characters.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Classical Chinese maintained divisions between educated and uneducated Chinese, putting literature beyond the reach of the common person and fashioning a cliquey lingua franca for Confucian officials, scholars and the erudite elite.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Classical novels evolved from the popular folk tales and dramas that entertained the lower classes. During the Ming dynasty they were penned in a semivernacular (or ‘vulgar’) language, and are often irreverently funny and full of action-packed fights.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Probably the best-known novel outside China is <em>Journey to the West</em> (Xīyóu Jì) – more commonly known as <em>Monkey</em>. Written in the 16th century, it follows the misadventures of a cowardly Buddhist monk (Tripitaka; a stand-in for the real-life pilgrim Xuan Zang) and his companions – a rebellious monkey, lecherous pig-man and exiled monster-immortal – on a pilgrimage to India.</p>
          <p class="body-text">The 14th-century novel <em>The</em> <em>Water Margin/Outlaws of the Marsh/All Men are Brothers</em> (Shuǐhǔ Zhuàn) is, on the surface, an excellent tale of honourable bandits and corrupt officials along the lines of Robin Hood. On a deeper level, though, it is a reminder to Confucian officials of their right to rebel when faced with a morally suspect government (at least one emperor officially banned it).</p>
          <p class="body-text">Written by Cao Xueqin and one of the most famous tales in Chinese literature, the <em>Dream of the Red Mansions</em> (Hónglóu Mèng) is an elaborate 18th-century novel penned in a vernacular, semiclassical form of Chinese. Also known as <em>The Story of the Stone</em>, the lavish tale relates the decline of an aristocratic family, affording a captivating overview of the mores and manners of upperclass Qing society.</p>
        
        <div class="sidebar">
          
            <p class="sidebar">The <em>I Ching</em> (<em>Yìjīng</em>; <em>Book of Changes</em>) is the oldest Chinese text and is used for divination. It is comprised of 64 hexagrams, composed of broken and continuous lines, that represent a balance of opposites (yin and yang), the inevitability of change and the evolution of events.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Classical Poetry</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">The earliest collection of Chinese poetry is the <em>Book of Songs</em> (Shījīng), which includes over 300 poems dating back to the 6th century BC, gathered together by royal musicians who lived in the many feudal states clustered along the banks of the Yellow River during the Zhou dynasty. Centred on themes of love, marriage, war, agriculture, hunting and sacrifice, the poems were originally meant to be sung.</p>
          <p class="body-text">China's greatest early poet is Qu Yuan, who lived during the Warring States period (475–221 BC) and is known for his romantic, lyrical poetry.</p>
          <p class="body-text">The Tang dynasty is considered to be the golden age of Chinese poetry, when two of China's greatest poets – Li Bai and Du Fu – lived and created some of the most beautiful and moving poems in classical Chinese. The most famous of these poems are gathered into an anthology called <em>300 Tang Poems</em>. During the Song dynasty, a lyric form of poetry called <em>cí</em> emerged, expressing feelings of passion and desire. Su Shi (Su Dongpo) is the most famous poet from this period.</p>
        
        <div class="sidebar">
          
            <p class="sidebar"><em>The Book and the Sword</em> by Jin Yong/Louis Cha (2004) is China’s most celebrated martial-arts novelist’s first book. The martial-arts genre <em>(wǔxiá xiǎoshuō)</em> is a direct descendant of the classical novel.</p>

        <h3>Modern Literature</h3>
        <div>
          <h4>Early 20th-Century Writing</h4>
          
            <p class="flush-left">Classical Chinese maintained its authority over literary minds until the early 20th century, when it came under the influence of the West.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Torch-bearing author Lu Xun wrote his short story <em>Diary of a Madman</em> in 1918. It was revolutionary stuff. Apart from the opening paragraph which is composed in classical Chinese, Lu’s seminal and shocking fable is cast entirely in colloquial Chinese.</p>
            <p class="body-text">For Lu Xun to write his short story in colloquial Chinese was explosive: readers were finally able to read language as it was spoken. <em>Diary of a Madman</em> is a haunting and unsettling work and from this moment on, mainstream Chinese literature would be written as it was thought and spoken: Chinese writing had been instantly revolutionised.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Other notable contemporaries of Lu Xun include Ba Jin (<em>Family;</em> 1931), Mao Dun (<em>Midnight;</em> 1933), Běijīng author Lao She (<em>Rickshaw Boy/Camel Xiangzi;</em> 1936) and the modernist playwright Cao Yu (<em>Thunderstorm</em>). Lu Xun and Ba Jin also translated a great deal of foreign literature into Chinese.</p>
          
          <div class="sidebar">
            
              <p class="sidebar">Published by the Chinese University of Hong Kong Research Centre for Translation, <em>Renditions</em> (<a href="http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/rct/renditions/index.html">www.cuhk.edu.hk/rct/renditions/index.html</a>) is an excellent journal of Chinese literature in English translation, covering works from classical Chinese to modern writing.</p>
            
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Contemporary Writing</h4>
          
            <p class="flush-left">A growing number of contemporary voices have been translated into English, but far more exist in Chinese only. The provocative Nobel Prize–winning Mo Yan (<em>Life and Death are Wearing Me Out;</em> 2008), Yu Hua (<em>To Live;</em> 1992) and Su Tong (<em>Rice;</em> 1995) have written momentous historical novels set in the 20th century; all are excellent, though their raw, harrowing subject matter is not for the faint of heart.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Zhu Wen mocks the get-rich movement in his brilliantly funny short stories, published in English as <em>I Love Dollars and Other Stories of China</em> (2007). It’s a vivid and comic portrayal of the absurdities of everyday China.</p>
            <p class="body-text">‘Hooligan author’ Wang Shuo (<em>Please Don’t Call Me Human;</em> 2000) is one of China’s best-selling authors with his political satires and convincing depictions of urban slackers. Alai (<em>Red Poppies;</em> 2002), an ethnic Tibetan, made waves by writing in Chinese about early 20th-century Tibetan Sìchuān – whatever your politics, it’s both insightful and a page-turner. Refused entry into China, exiled author Ma Jian writes more politically critical work; his 2001 novel <em>Red Dust</em> was a Kerouacian tale of wandering China as a spiritual pollutant in the 1980s. Banned in China, his 2008 novel <em>Beijing Coma</em> is set against the Tiān’ānmén demonstrations of 1989, and their aftermath. China’s most renowned dissident writer, Gao Xingjian, won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2000 for his novel <em>Soul Mountain,</em> an account of his travels along the Yangzi after being misdiagnosed with lung cancer. All of his work has been banned in the People's Republic of China (PRC) since 1989.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Controversial blogger Han Han (<a href="http://blog.sina.com.cn/twocold">http://blog.sina.com.cn/twocold</a>) catapulted himself into the literary spotlight with his novel <em>Triple Door,</em> a searing critique of China’s education system. His successful 2010 road-trip novel <em>1988: I Want to Talk with the World</em> only served to grow his already massive fan base and establish him as spokesman of a generation.</p>
            <p class="body-text"><em>Candy</em> (2003) by Mian Mian is a hip take on modern Shànghǎi life, penned by a former heroin addict musing on complicated sexual affairs, suicide and drug addiction in Shēnzhèn and Shànghǎi. It's applauded for its urban underground tone, but sensational more for its framing of post-adolescent themes in contemporary China. <em>Years of Red Dust: Stories of Shanghai</em> (2010) by Qiu Xiaolong contains 23 short stories in the context of momentous historic events affecting the city and the inhabitants of Red Dust Lane.</p>
            <p class="body-text">In his novel <em>Banished,</em> poet, essayist, short-story writer and blogger Han Dong reaches to his own experiences during the Cultural Revolution for inspiration. Winner of the Man Asian Literary Prize in 2010, Bi Feiyu’s <em>Three Sisters</em> is a poignant tale of rural China during the political chaos of the early 1970s. In <em>Northern Girls,</em> Sheng Keyi illuminates the prejudices and bigotries of modern Chinese society in her story of a Chinese girl arriving as an immigrant worker in Shēnzhèn. <em>The Fat Years</em> (2009) by Chan Koonchung is a science-fiction novel set in a near-future totalitarian China where the month of February 2011 has gone missing from official records.</p>
            <p class="body-text">For a taste of contemporary Chinese short-story writing with both English and Chinese, buy a copy of <em>Short Stories in Chinese: New Penguin Parallel Text</em> (2012). <em>The Picador Book of Contemporary Chinese Fiction</em> (2006) brings together a range of different contemporary voices and themes into one accessible book.</p>
          
          <div class="sidebar">
            
              <p class="sidebar"><em>Wolf Totem</em> (2009) by Jiang Rong is an astonishing look at life on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia during the Cultural Revolution and the impact of modern culture on an ancient way of life.</p>

      <h2>Film</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Early Cinema</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">The moving image in the Middle Kingdom dates to 1896, when Spaniard Galen Bocca unveiled a film projector and blew the socks off wide-eyed crowds in a Shànghǎi teahouse. Shànghǎi’s cosmopolitan verve and exotic looks would make it the capital of China’s film industry, but China’s very first movie – <em>Conquering Jun Mountain</em> (an excerpt from a piece of Běijīng opera) – was actually filmed in Běijīng in 1905.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Shànghǎi opened its first cinema in 1908. In those days, cinema owners would cannily run the film for a few minutes, stop it and collect money from the audience before allowing the film to continue. The golden age of Shànghǎi film-making came in the 1930s when the city had over 140 film companies. Its apogee arrived in 1937 with the release of <em>Street Angel,</em> a powerful drama about two sisters who flee the Japanese in northeast China and end up as prostitutes in Shànghǎi; and <em>Crossroads,</em> a clever comedy about four unemployed graduates. Japanese control of China eventually brought the industry to a standstill and sent many film-makers packing.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Communist Decline</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">China’s film industry was stymied after the Communist Revolution, which sent film-makers scurrying to Hong Kong and Taiwan, where they played key roles in building up the local film industries that flourished there. Cinematic production in China was co-opted to glorify communism and generate patriotic propaganda. The days of the Cultural Revolution (1966–76) were particularly dark. Between 1966 and 1972, just eight movies were made on the mainland, as the film industry was effectively shut down.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Resurgence</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">It wasn’t until two years after the death of Mao Zedong, in September 1978, that China’s premier film school – the Běijīng Film Academy – reopened. Its first intake of students included Zhang Yimou, Chen Kaige and Tian Zhuangzhuang, who are considered masterminds of the celebrated ‘Fifth Generation’.</p>
          <p class="body-text">The cinematic output of the Fifth Generation signalled an escape from the dour, colourless and proletarian Mao era, and a second glittering golden age of Chinese film-making arrived in the 1980s and 1990s with their lush and lavish tragedies. A bleak but beautifully shot tale of a Chinese Communist Party cadre who travels to a remote village in Shaanxi province to collect folk songs, Chen Kaige’s <em>Yellow Earth</em> aroused little interest in China but proved a sensation when released in the West in 1985.</p>
          <p class="body-text">It was followed by Zhang’s <em>Red Sorghum,</em> which introduced Gong Li and Jiang Wen to the world. Gong became the poster girl of Chinese cinema in the 1990s and the first international movie star to emerge from the mainland. Jiang, the Marlon Brando of Chinese film, has proved both a durable leading man and an innovative, controversial director of award-winning films such as <em>In the Heat of the Sun</em> and <em>Devils on the Doorstep</em>.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Rich, seminal works such as <em>Farewell My Concubine</em> (1993; Chen Kaige) and <em>Raise the Red Lantern</em> (1991; Zhang Yimou) were garlanded with praise, receiving standing ovations and winning major film awards. Their directors were the darlings of Cannes; Western cinema-goers were entranced. Many Chinese cinema-goers also admired their artistry, but some saw Fifth Generation output as pandering to the Western market.</p>
          <p class="body-text">In 1993 Tian Zhuangzhuang made the brilliant <em>The Blue Kite</em>. A heartbreaking account of the life of one Běijīng family during the Cultural Revolution, it so enraged the censors that Tian was banned from making films for a decade.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Each generation charts its own course and the ensuing Sixth Generation – graduating from the Běijīng Film Academy post–Tiān’ānmén Square protests – was no different.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Sixth Generation film directors eschewed the luxurious beauty of their forebears, and sought to capture the angst and grit of modern urban Chinese life. Their independent, low-budget works put an entirely different and more cynical spin on mainland Chinese film-making, but their darker subject matter and harsh film style (frequently in black and white) left many Western viewers cold.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Independent film-making found an influential precedent with Zhang Yuan’s 1990 debut <em>Mama</em>. Zhang is also acclaimed for his candid and gritty documentary-style <em>Beijing Bastards</em> (1993).</p>
          <p class="body-text">Meanwhile, <em>The Days,</em> directed by Wang Xiaoshui, follows a couple drifting apart in the wake of the Tiān’ānmén Square protests. Wang also directed the excellent <em>Beijing Bicycle</em> (2001), inspired by De Sica’s <em>Bicycle Thieves</em>.</p>
        
        <div class="sidebar">
          
            <p class="sidebar">The 2010 remake of <em>The Karate Kid,</em> starring Jackie Chan, is set in Běijīng and authentically conveys the city despite having nothing to do with karate.</p>

      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Traditional Architecture</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Four principal styles governed traditional Chinese architecture: imperial, religious, residential and recreational. The imperial style was naturally the most grandiose, overseeing the design of buildings employed by successive dynastic rulers; the religious style was employed for the construction of temples, monasteries and pagodas; while the residential and recreational styles took care of the design of houses and private gardens.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Whatever the style, Chinese buildings traditionally followed a similar basic ground plan, consisting of a symmetrical layout oriented around a central axis – ideally running north–south to conform with basic feng shui (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">风水</span></span><em>; fēngshuǐ</em>) dictates and to maximise sunshine – with an enclosed courtyard (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">院</span></span><em>; yuàn)</em> flanked by buildings on all sides.</p>
          <p class="body-text">In many aspects, imperial palaces are glorified courtyard homes (south-facing, a sequence of courtyards, side halls and perhaps a garden at the rear) completed on a different scale. Apart from the size, the main dissimilarity would be guard towers on the walls and possibly a moat, imperial yellow roof tiles, ornate dragon carvings (signifying the emperor), the repetitive use of the number nine and the presence of temples.</p>
        
        <div class="context-eps"><img alt="lpt0809021jpg" src="images/lpt0809_021.jpg"/></div><div class="caption"><span>Incense sticks | </span><span>MARK READ/LONELY PLANET ©</span></div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Religious Architecture</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Chinese Buddhist, Taoist and Confucian temples tend to follow a strict, schematic pattern. All temples are laid out on a north–south axis in a series of halls, with the main door of each hall facing south.</p>
          <p class="body-text">With their sequence of halls and buildings interspersed with breezy open-air courtyards, Chinese temples are very different from Christian churches. The roofless courtyards allow the weather to permeate within the temple and permits <em>qì</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">气; </span></span>spirit) to circulate, dispersing stale air and allowing incense to be burned.</p>
        
        <div>
          <h4>Buddhist Temples</h4>
          
            <p class="flush-left">Once you have cracked the logic of Buddhist temples, you will see how most temples conform to a basic pattern. The first hall and portal to the temple is generally the Hall of Heavenly Kings (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">天王殿; </span></span>Tiānwáng Diàn), where a sedentary, central statue of the tubby Bodhisattva Maitreya is flanked by the stern and often ferocious Four Heavenly Kings. Behind is the first courtyard, where the Drum Tower (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">鼓楼; </span></span>Gǔlóu) and Bell Tower (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">钟楼; </span></span>Zhōnglóu) may rise to the east and west, and smoking braziers may be positioned.</p>
            <p class="body-text">The main hall is often the Great Treasure Hall (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">大雄宝殿; </span></span>Dàxióngbǎo Diàn) sheltering glittering statues of the past, present and future Buddhas, seated in a row. This is the main focal point for worshippers at the temple. On the east and west interior wall of the hall are often 18 <em>luóhàn</em> (arhat – a Buddhist who has achieved enlightenment) in two lines, either as statues or paintings. In some temples, they gather in a throng of 500, housed in a separate hall, usually called the Luohan Hall (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">罗汉殿; </span></span>Luóhàn Diàn). A statue of Guanyin (the Goddess of Mercy) frequently stands at the rear of the main hall, facing north, atop a fish’s head or a rocky outcrop. The goddess may also have her own hall and occasionally presents herself with a huge fan of arms, in her ‘Thousand Arm’ incarnation – the awesome effigy of Guanyin in the Mahayana Hall at Pǔníng Temple in Chéngdé is the supreme example.</p>
            <p class="body-text">The rear hall may be where the sutras (Buddhist scriptures) were once stored, in which case it will be called the Sutra Storing Building. A pagoda may rise above the main halls or may be the only surviving fragment of an otherwise destroyed temple. Conceived to house the remains of Buddha and later other Buddhist relics, sutras, religious artefacts and documents, a pagoda (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">塔; </span></span>tǎ) may rise above the temple.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Many Buddhist temples also have a vegetarian restaurant in one of the halls that has been converted for use as a canteen, which may be open to the public, serving meat-free, affordable food.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="box-text box">
          <h3>BATTLE OF THE BUDDHAS</h3>
          
            <p class="box-flush-left">China’s largest ancient Buddha gazes out over the confluence of the waters of the Dàdù River and the Mín River at Lèshān in Sìchuān. When the even bigger Buddha at Bamyan in Afghanistan was demolished by the Taliban, the Lèshān Buddha enjoyed instantaneous promotion to the top spot as the world’s largest. The Buddha in the Great Buddha Temple at Zhāngyè in Gānsù province may not take it lying down, though: he is China’s largest ‘housed reclining Buddha’. Chinese children once climbed inside him to scamper about within his cavernous tummy.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">Lounging around in second place is the reclining Buddha in the Mògāo Grottoes, China’s second largest. The vast (and modern) reclining Buddha at Lèshān is a whopping 170m long and the world’s largest ‘alfresco’ reclining Buddha. Bristling with limbs, the Thousand Arm Guanyin statue in the Pǔníng Temple’s Mahayana Hall in Chéngdé also stands up to be counted: she’s the largest wooden statue in China (and possibly the world). Not to be outdone, Hong Kong fights for its niche with the Tian Tan Buddha Statue, the world’s ‘largest outdoor seated bronze Buddha statue’.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Taoist Temples</h4>
          
            <p class="flush-left">Taoist shrines are not as plentiful and are generally more nether-worldly than Buddhist shrines, although the basic layout echoes Buddhist temples. They are decorated with a distinct set of motifs, including the <em>bāguà</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">八卦; </span></span>eight trigrams) formations, reflected in eight-sided pavilions and halls, and the Taiji yin/yang <em>(yīn/yáng)</em> diagram. Effigies of Laotzu, the Jade Emperor and other characters popularly associated with Taoist myth, such as the Eight Immortals, Guandi and the God of Wealth, are customary.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Taoist door gods, similar to those in Buddhist temples, often guard temple entrances; the main hall is usually called the Hall of the Three Clear Ones (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">三清殿; </span></span>Sānqīng Diàn), devoted to a triumvirate of Taoist deities. Pagodas are generally absent.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Taoist monks (and nuns) are easily distinguished from their shaven-headed Buddhist confrères by their long hair, twisted into topknots, straight trousers and squarish jackets.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Confucian Temples</h4>
          
            <p class="flush-left">Unless they have vanished or been destroyed, Confucian temples can be found in the old town district of ancient settlements throughout China and are typically very quiet havens of peace and far less visited than Buddhist or Taoist temples. The largest Confucian temple in China is at Qūfù in Shāndōng, Confucius’ birthplace.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Confucian temples are called either Kǒng Miào (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">孔庙</span></span>) or Wén Miào (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">文庙</span></span>) in Chinese and bristle with stelae celebrating local scholars, some supported on the backs of <em>bìxì</em> (mythical tortoiselike dragons). A statue of Kongzi (Confucius) usually resides in the main hall (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">大成殿; </span></span>Dàchéng Diàn), overseeing rows of dusty musical instruments and flanked by disciples and philosophers.</p>
            <p class="body-text">A mythical animal, the <em>qílín</em>, is commonly seen at Confucian temples. The <em>qílín</em> was a chimera that only appeared on earth in times of harmony.</p>

              <p class="sidebar">Discovered by amateur astronomer William Kwong Yu Yeung in 2001, the main belt asteroid '83598 Aiweiwei' was named after Chinese artist Ai Weiwei in 2001.</p>

          <h4>Modern Architecture</h4>
          
            <p class="flush-left">Architecturally speaking, anything goes in today’s China. You only have to look at the Pǔdōng skyline to discover a melange of competing designs, some dramatic, inspiring and novel, others rash. The display represents a nation brimming over with confidence, zeal and money.</p>
            <p class="body-text">If modern architecture in China is regarded as anything post-1949, then China has ridden a roller-coaster ride of styles and fashions. In Běijīng, stand between the Great Hall of the People (1959) and the National Centre for the Performing Arts (2008) and weigh up how far China travelled in 50 years. Interestingly, neither building has clear Chinese motifs. The same applies to the form of Běijīng’s CCTV Building, where a continuous loop through horizontal and vertical planes required some audacious engineering.</p>
            <p class="body-text">The coastal areas are an architect’s dreamland – no design is too outrageous, zoning laws have been scrapped, and the labour force is large and inexpensive. Planning permission can be simple to arrange – often all it requires is sufficient <em>guānxī</em> (connections). Even the once cash-strapped interior provinces are getting in on the act. Opened in Chéngdū in 2013, the staggeringly large New Century Global Center is the world's largest free-standing building: big enough to swallow up 20 Sydney Opera Houses!</p>
            <p class="body-text">Many of the top names in international architecture – IM Pei, Rem Koolhaas, Norman Foster, Kengo Kuma, Jean-Marie Charpentier, Herzog &amp; de Meuron – have all designed at least one building in China in the past decade. Other impressive examples of modern architecture include the National Stadium (aka the ‘Bird’s Nest’), the National Aquatics Center (aka the ‘Water Cube’) and Běijīng South train station, all in Běijīng; and the art deco–esque Jīnmào Tower, the towering Shànghǎi World Financial Center, Tomorrow Square and the Shànghǎi Tower in Shànghǎi. In Guǎngzhōu, the Zaha Hadid–designed Guǎngzhōu Opera House is an astonishing contemporary creation, both inside and out. In Hong Kong, the glittering 2 International Finance Center on Hong Kong Island and the International Commerce Center in Kowloon are each prodigious examples of modern skyscraper architecture.</p>
            <p class="body-text">For something rather different, Jīnhuá Architecture Park, a project of artist Ai Weiwei, is an abandoned, overgrown, mouldering yet thought-provoking collection of modern memorial pavilions (designed by such names as Herzog &amp; de Meuron), slowly returning to nature. They can be found in Jīnhuá, Zhèjiāng province.</p>
