      <p class="flush-left">Trains are the best way to travel long distance around China in reasonable speed and comfort. They are also adventurous, exciting, fun, practical and efficient, and ticket prices are reasonable to boot. Colossal investment over recent years has put high-speed rail at the heart of China’s rapid modernisation drive. You really don’t have to be a trainspotter to find China’s railways a riveting subculture; as a plus you'll get to meet the Chinese people at their most relaxed and sociable.</p>
    
    <div>
      <h2 id="ref-chinas-train-network">China's Train Network</h2>
      
        <p class="flush-left">One of the world’s most extensive rail networks, passenger railways penetrate every province in China and high-speed connections are suddenly everywhere. In line with China’s frantic economic development and the pressures of transporting 1.4 billion people across the world’s third-largest nation, expansion of China’s rail network over the past decade has been mind-boggling.</p>
        <p class="body-text">The network currently totals over 103,000km in length. In China, thousands of kilometres of track are laid every year and new express trains have been zipping across the land since 2007, shrinking once daunting distances. State-of-the-art train stations are ceaselessly appearing, many to serve high-speed links. You can climb aboard a train in Běijīng or Shànghǎi and alight in Tibet’s capital (although ticket scarcity for trains into Lhasa means it’s easier to fly in and take the train out); lines are poking further into Tibet, with a line to Shigatse. The time to get to Yánjí (near the South Korean border) from Chángchūn in northeast China has recently been slashed by hours. The highly anticipated Xī'ān–Chéngdū line will hopefully open by 2018 and will cut travel times from 13 hours to under three hours.</p>
        <p class="body-text">With the advent of high-speed D, G and C class express trains, getting between major cities is increasingly a breeze (albeit far more expensive than regular fast trains). High-speed rail has put the squeeze on numerous domestic air routes and the punctuality of trains sees far fewer delays than air travel. Useful high-speed links that have opened in recent years have connected Běijīng and Xī’ān, Lánzhōu and Ürümqi, and Tiānjīn and Bǎoding; there is even talk of extending links through Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran and Turkey to Bulgaria. Down south, China is also planning a high-speed link from Kūnmíng in Yúnnán to Singapore, via Laos, Thailand and Malaysia.</p>

      <h2 id="ref-train-travel">Train Travel</h2>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Trains are generally highly punctual in China and are usually a safe way to travel. Train stations are often conveniently close to the centre of town. Travelling on sleeper berths at night means you can frequently arrive at your destination first thing in the morning, saving a night’s hotel accommodation. Think ahead, get your tickets early and you can sleep your way around a lot of China.</p>
        <p class="body-text">On entering a large, old-style station (such as Běijīng West Train Station), you will have to find the correct waiting room number, displayed on an illuminated screen as you walk in. Modern stations (such as Shànghǎi Hóngqiáo Train Station) are more straightforward and intelligently designed, without waiting rooms; instead your platform number will appear on the screen.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Trolleys of food and drink are wheeled along carriages during the trip, but prices are high and the selection is limited. You can also load up on mineral water and snacks at stations, where hawkers sell items from platform stalls. Long-distance trains should have a canteen carriage (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">餐厅车厢; </span></span><em>cāntīng chēxiāng</em>); they are sometimes open through the night.</p>
        <p class="body-text">In each class of sleeper, linen is clean and changed for each journey; beds are generally bedbug-free.</p>
        <p class="body-text">If taking a sleeper train, you will generally be required to exchange your paper ticket for a plastic or metal card with your bunk number on it. The conductor then knows when you are due to disembark, and will awake you in time to return your ticket to you.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Some tips regarding train travel:</p>
        
          <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>Don’t wait to board your train until the last minute, as queues outside the main train station entrance can be shocking.</p>
          <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>You are required to pass your bags through a security scanner at the station entrance.</p>
          <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>Keep passports handy when entering a station as checks will match the name on your ticket with the name on your passport.</p>
          <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>Keep your ticket handy after disembarking the train as there can be checks when exiting the platform and ticket-fed turnstiles in newer stations.</p>
          <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>On a nonsleeper, ask a member of staff or a fellow passenger to tell you when your station arrives.</p>

        <h3>TRAVELLING THE TRANS-SIBERIAN RAILWAY</h3>
        
          <p class="box-flush-left">Rolling out of Europe and into Asia, through eight time zones and over 9289km of taiga, steppe and desert, the Trans-Siberian Railway and its connecting routes constitute one of the most famous and most romantic of the world’s great train journeys.</p>
          <p class="box-body-text">There are, in fact, three railways. The ‘true’ <strong>Trans-Siberian</strong> line runs from Moscow to Vladivostok. But the routes traditionally referred to as the Trans-Siberian Railway are the two branches that veer off the main line in eastern Siberia for Běijīng.</p>
          <p class="box-body-text">Since the first option excludes China, most readers of this guide will be choosing between the <strong>Trans-Mongolian</strong> and the <strong>Trans-Manchurian</strong> railway lines. The Trans-Mongolian route (Běijīng to Moscow; 7865km) is faster, but requires an additional visa and another border crossing – on the plus side, you also get to see some of the Mongolian countryside. The Trans-Manchurian route is longer (Běijīng to Moscow; 9025km).</p>
        
        <div>
          <h3>TRANS-MONGOLIAN RAILWAY</h3>
          
            <p class="box-flush-left">Trains offer deluxe two-berth compartments (with shared shower), 1st-class four-berth compartments and 2nd-class four-berth compartments. Tickets for 2nd class/1st class/deluxe cost from around ¥3496/5114/5064 to Moscow, ¥1222/1723/1883 to Ulaanbaatar and ¥2559/3734/4052 to Novosibirsk. Ticket prices are cheaper if you travel in a group. The K23 service departs on Sunday (2nd/1st class ¥1259/1849, 11.22am, 30 hours) and terminates at Ulaanbaatar on Monday.</p>

        <p class="body-text">D class trains were the first high-speed trains to appear and breathlessly glide around China at high speed, offering substantial comfort and regular services. Their temperature-regulated 1st-class carriages have mobile and laptop chargers; seats are two abreast with ample legroom and TV sets. Second-class carriages have five seats in two rows. G class trains are faster than D class trains, but have limited luggage space.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Less fast express classes include the overnight Z class trains, while further down the pecking order are older and more basic T and K class trains.</p>

        <p class="flush-left">It is possible to upgrade (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">补票; </span></span><em>bǔpiào</em>) your ticket once aboard your train. If you have a standing ticket, for example, find the conductor and upgrade to a hard seat, soft seat or hard sleeper (if there are any available).</p>
      
      <div>
        <h3>Soft Sleeper</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Soft sleepers are a very comfortable way to travel and work perfectly as mobile hotels; tickets cost much more than hard-sleeper tickets and often sell out, however, so book early. Soft sleepers vary between trains and the best are on the more recent D and Z class trains. All Z class trains are soft-sleeper trains, with very comfortable, up-to-date berths. A few T class trains also offer two-berth compartments, with their own toilet.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Tickets for upper berths are slightly cheaper than for lower berths. Expect to share with total strangers. If you are asleep, an attendant will wake you to prepare you to disembark so you will have plenty of time to ready your things. Available on some lines, two-bed deluxe soft sleepers usually have a toilet and sink. VIP sleepers, essentially three-bed compartments which one person can book in its entirety, are available on the Kūnmíng–Lìjiāng route.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Soft sleeper carriages contain:</p>
          
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>four air-conditioned bunks (upper and lower) in a closed compartment</p>
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>bedding on each berth and a lockable door to the carriage corridor</p>
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>meals, flat-screen TVs and power sockets on some routes</p>
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>a small table and stowing space for your bags</p>
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>a hot-water flask for drinking (plain or for tea) or instant noodles, filled by an attendant (one per compartment).</p>
          
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Hard Sleeper</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Hard sleepers are available on slower and less modern T, K and N class trains, as well as trains without a letter prefix. As with soft sleepers, they serve very nicely as an overnight hotel.</p>
          <p class="body-text">There is a small price difference between the numbered berths, with the lowest bunk (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">下铺; </span></span><em>xiàpù</em>) the most expensive and the highest bunk (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">上铺; </span></span><em>shàngpù)</em> the cheapest. The middle bunk (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">中铺; </span></span><em>zhōngpù</em>) is a good choice, as all and sundry invade the lower berth to use it as a seat during the day, while the top one has little headroom and puts you near the speakers. As with soft sleepers, an attendant will wake you well in advance of your station.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Hard-sleeper tickets are the most difficult of all to buy; you almost always need to buy these a few days in advance. Expect:</p>
          
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>doorless compartments with half a dozen bunks in three tiers</p>
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>sheets, pillows and blankets on each berth</p>

        <h3>Seats</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Soft-seat class is more comfortable but not nearly as common as hard-seat class. First-class (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">一等; </span></span><em>yīděng</em>) and 2nd-class (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">二等; </span></span>è<em>rděng</em>) soft seats are available in D, C and G class high-speed trains. G class trains also offer business class and/or VIP seats, which include a hot meal and added comfort. High-speed trains are truly nonsmoking, unlike other trains, which allow smoking between carriages, inevitably carrying through into the carriages.</p>
          <p class="body-text">First-class comes with TVs, mobile phone and laptop charging points, and seats arranged two abreast.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Second-class soft seats are also very comfortable; staff are very courteous throughout. Overcrowding is not permitted and power points are available. On older trains, soft-seat carriages are often double-decker, and are not as plush as the faster and more modern high-speed express trains.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Hard-seat class is not available on the faster and plusher C, D and G class trains, and is only found on T and K class trains and trains without a number prefix; a handful of Z class trains have hard seats. Hard-seat class generally has padded seats, but it’s hard on your sanity: often unclean and noisy, and painful on the long haul.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Since hard seat is the only class most locals can afford, it’s packed to the gills.</p>
          <p class="body-text">You should get a ticket with an assigned seat number; if seats have sold out, ask for a standing ticket, which gets you on the train, where you may find a seat or can upgrade. Otherwise you will have to stand in the carriage or between carriages (with the smokers).</p>
          <p class="body-text">Hard-seat sections on China’s newer trains are air-conditioned and less crowded.</p>

        <h3>Buying Tickets</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">The Achilles heel of China’s overburdened rail system, buying tickets can be a pain.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Most tickets are one-way only, with prices calculated per kilometre and adjustments made depending on class of train, availability of air-con, type of sleeper and bunk positioning.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Some tips on buying train tickets:</p>
          
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>Never aim to get a sleeper ticket on the day of travel – plan and purchase ahead.</p>
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>Most tickets can be booked 18 days in advance of your departure date when booking in person at ticket offices and 20 days when booking online.</p>
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>Buying tickets for hard-seat carriages at short notice is usually no hassle, but it may be a standing ticket rather than a numbered seat.</p>
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>Tickets can be purchased only with cash or bank cards that are part of the Chinese UnionPay network.</p>
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>You will need your passport when buying a ticket (the number is printed on your ticket) at all train ticket offices. Your name will also appear on tickets bought online.</p>
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>All automated ticket machines (eg at Shànghǎi Train Station) require Chinese ID – your passport will not work, so you will need to queue at the ticket window.</p>
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>As with air travel, buying tickets around the Chinese New Year and the 1 May and 1 October holiday periods can be very difficult.</p>
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>Tickets on many routes (such as to Lhasa) can be very hard to get in July and August; consider flying to distant destinations.</p>
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>Expect to queue for up to 30 minutes or more for a train ticket at the station; ticket offices outside of the station are often less busy.</p>
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>Avoid black-market tickets: your passport number must be on the ticket for it to be valid.</p>
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>Refunds for lost train tickets are arduous and involve purchasing a new ticket and getting a refund at the other end once it has been proved no one occupied your seat.</p>
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>If you miss your D or G class train, you will be allowed to take the next available train on the same day only at no charge. For all other trains, your ticket is forfeited (unless your connecting train was late).</p>
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>Booking tickets on apps lets you avoid missing out. A fee of ¥20 to ¥40 applies, and tickets still need to be picked up from a ticket collection window (often with a queue) at any train station.</p>
          
          <p class="body-text">Your ticket will display:</p>
          
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>the train number</p>
            <p class="list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>the name of your departure and destination stations in Chinese and pinyin</p>

          <p class="flush-left">Ticket offices (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">售票厅; </span></span><em>shòupiàotīng</em>) at train stations are usually to one side of the main train station entrance. Automated ticket machines operate on some routes but never accept foreign passports as ID. At large stations there should be a window staffed by someone with basic English skills.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Alternatively, independent train ticket offices usually exist elsewhere in town, where tickets can be purchased for a ¥5 commission without the same kind of queues; we list these where possible. Larger post offices may also sell train tickets. Your hotel will also be able to rustle up a ticket for you for a commission, and so can a travel agent.</p>
          <p class="body-text">It’s cheaper to buy your ticket at the station, but tickets can be bought online at the following (China DIY Travel is the cheapest) and collected from any train before travel:</p>

          <p class="body-text">To get a refund (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">退票; </span></span><em>tuìpiào</em>) on an unused ticket, look for the specifically marked windows at large train stations, where you can get from 80 to 95% of your ticket value back, depending on how many days prior to the departure date you cancel.</p>
