 <h3>Why Go?</h3>
 
 <p class="flush-left">China's largest province, Xīnjiāng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">新疆</span></span>) is the homeland of the Muslim Uighurs and a fast-changing region where ancient and modern grind up against each other in surprising ways. High-speed railways crothere ss the Martian landscapes linking cities in hours rather than days, and the regional capital Ürümqi is a forest of high-rise apartments and glass skyscrapers; while in parts of the Silk Road oases of Kashgar, Hotan and Turpan, life goes as it has for centuries, based around the mosque, the tea house and the bazaar.</p>
 <p class="body-text">Despite the enormous military and police presence here due to several years of ethnic unrest, Xīnjiāng is increasingly attracting visitors for its extraordinary natural beauty and fascinating Central Asian history and culture. In short, a visit to Chinese Turkestan makes for an exploration of China's past and its unsettled multicultural present, or simply a journey into some of the most sublime landscapes on earth.</p>

 <div class="history">
 <h3>History</h3>
 <p class="flush-left">By the end of the 2nd century BC, the expanding Han dynasty had pushed its borders west into what is now Xīnjiāng. Military garrisons protected the fledgling trade routes, as silk flowed out of the empire in return for the strong Ferghana horses needed to fight nomadic incursions from the north. Chinese imperial rule waxed and waned over the centuries, shrinking after the collapse of the Han and reasserting itself during the 7th-century Tang, though central control was tenuous at best. A Uighur kingdom based at Khocho thrived from the 8th century and oversaw the Central Asian people’s transformation from nomads to farmers and from Manichaeans to Buddhists.</p>
 <p class="body-text">It was during Kharakhanid rule in the 10th to 12th centuries that Islam took hold in Xīnjiāng. In 1219, Ili (modern Yīníng), Hotan and Kashgar fell to the Mongols and their various successors controlled the whole of Central Asia until the mid-18th century, when the Manchu army marched into Kashgar.</p>
 <p class="body-text">In 1865, a Kokandi officer named Yaqub Beg seized Kashgaria, proclaimed a short-lived independent Turkestan, and made diplomatic contacts with Britain and Russia. The Manchu army eventually returned and two decades later Kashgaria was formally incorporated into China’s newly created Xīnjiāng (New Frontier) province. With the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, Xīnjiāng came under the chaotic and violent rule of a succession of Muslim and Chinese warlords, over whom the Kuomintang (the Nationalist Party) had very little control. In the 1930s and 1940s there was an attempt in both Kashgar and Ili to establish an independent state of Eastern Turkestan, but both were short-lived.</p>
 <p class="body-text">Since 1949, the Chinese government's main social goal in Xīnjiāng has been to keep a lid on ethnic separatism, dilute local culture, and flood the region with Han Chinese. Economically, the ‘Develop the West’ campaign has used the region’s oil resources to ramp up the local economy. But this has led to an increase in Han settlers, which has exacerbated ethnic tensions. In a telling statistic, Uighurs once composed 90% of Xīnjiāng’s population; today they make up less than 50%. But despite the unease and resentment of the native population, Xīnjiāng remained peaceful throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, even as China began to open up to the outside world.</p>
 <p class="body-text">However, in 2008, street protests and bomb attacks rocked the province, and in 2009 communal violence between Han and Uighur civilians in central Ürümqi led to around 200 deaths and 1700 injuries, according to Chinese police reports. Protests, riots and terrorist acts have continued to simmer ever since, though 2014 was a recent high watermark, with a knife attack at a train station in Kūnmíng that killed 29 and injured 143 being blamed on Uighur separatists. The next month, two attackers stabbed people at the Ürümqi train station before setting off vest explosives. A few weeks later, a suicide car and bomb attack on a market in Ürümqi ended with 31 killed and 90 injured. As a direct result, the Chinese authorities launched a huge security crack down, the results of which can still be seen on any street corner in the province. Hundreds of Uighurs were sentenced to long jail terms and dozens were executed.</p>
 <p class="body-text">The current situation remains tense. As long as Uighur resentment continues to be fuelled by what they view as economic marginalisation, cultural restrictions, ethnic discrimination and outright oppression, violence looks likely to remain a threat in the restive province, though as travellers are highly unlikely to be caught up in this, there is no reason to avoid travelling to Xīnjiāng.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="history">
 <h3>Climate </h3>
 <p class="flush-left">Xīnjiāng’s climate is one of extremes. Turpan is the hottest spot in the country – temperatures of 54°C have been recorded in the summer months – while the Tarim and Jungar Basins aren’t much cooler. Spring (April and May) is a much better time to travel temperature-wise, though frequent sandstorms can sometimes obscure the landscape. Winters (November to March) see the mercury plummet below 0°C throughout the province, although March is a good time to catch some festivals. Late May, June, September and (especially) October are the best times to visit.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="history">
 <h3>Language</h3>
 <p class="flush-left">Uighur, the traditional language of Xīnjiāng, is part of the Turkic language family and is thus fairly similar to other regional languages, including Uzbek, Kazakh and Kyrgyz. While previously written using Latin letters, it is nowadays written using the Arabic alphabet. Learning a few words and phrases will mean the world to Uighur people you meet on your travels.</p>
 <p class="body-text">In general, the Han Chinese in Xīnjiāng don’t speak Uighur, though there is a growing number of exceptions to this rule among the younger generation, as both languages are now compulsory in schools. Many Uighurs can’t – or won’t – speak Mandarin, and even fewer can read Chinese characters proficiently.</p>
 <p class="body-text">English is spoken by almost nobody, even in the hotel industry. Basic Chinese, a Chinese phrasebook or judicious use of Google Translate are your only hope at communication in most cases.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="box-text box two-column">
 <h3>DANGERS &amp; ANNOYANCES</h3>
 <p class="box-flush-left">Due to the unrest and terrorism that has been a rare – but recurring – feature of life in Xīnjiāng since 2008, and which most recently peaked again in 2014, the province today has a very visible military and police presence, which can unnerve some. Foreigners are actually of little or no interest to these patrols, whose main function is to deter any public protest in the cities, and to check the passports of anyone travelling by train or bus. It's essential that you carry your passport with you at all times; you're simply asking for trouble otherwise. The main annoyance for travellers is the sheer amount of time that just getting into a train station can take, or the number of stops a long-distance bus is obliged to make, during which Chinese citizens will be required to disembark to have their IDs scanned. As foreign passports cannot be scanned in this way, you may or may not be required to disembark yourself; await instructions at each checkpoint. Note that you may not bring cigarette lighters, scissors or anything that could potentially be used as a weapon, however seemingly innocuous, onto any bus or train.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="info">
 <p class="info-heading-1 getting-there-away"><samp class="font-icon">8</samp>Getting There &amp; Away</p>
 <p class="info-flush-left">You can fly between Xīnjiāng and most of the larger Chinese cities, as well as to several Central Asian capitals and a couple of cities further afield, including Moscow, Tehran, Dubai, Seoul and Istanbul.</p>
 <p class="info-body-text">There are overland border crossings with Pakistan (Khunjerab Pass), Kyrgyzstan (Irkeshtam and Torugart Passes) and Kazakhstan (Korgas, Ālāshānkǒu, Tǎchéng and Jímùnǎi). The Qolma Pass to Tajikistan remains closed to foreign travel, sadly. All of these border crossings are by bus, except Ālāshānkǒu, China’s only rail link to Central Asia. A new high-speed railway line to Pakistan is under construction.</p>
 <p class="info-body-text">Heading back into mainland China, the obvious route is the train line following the Silk Road through Gānsù. More rugged approaches are the mountain roads from Charklik to Qīnghǎi, and Karghilik to Ali (Tibet).</p>
 
 </div>
 <div class="info">
 <p class="info-heading-1 getting-around"><samp class="font-icon">8</samp>Getting Around</p>
 
 <p class="info-flush-left">Xīnjiāng is enormous (slightly bigger than Iran), and getting around usually takes time, money or both. The bus is the standard way to get around, and while bus journeys are cheap, new laws forbidding drivers to drive overnight and constant document checks along the way have increased travel times over the past few years. Buses are often sleepers, which means you're on either the top (cheaper) or bottom (pricier) bunk, arranged in three lines down the middle of the bus. On-board entertainment usually includes kung fu–film marathons cranked to the hilt. Shared taxis run along many of the bus routes, taking up to half as long, and costing twice as much as buses. Shared taxis only depart when full.</p>
 <p class="info-body-text">In 2015, the brand new Ürümqi–Lánzhōu high-speed railway line opened, massively cutting travel times within Eastern Xīnjiāng. In the west of the province, train journeys are not nearly as fast, but they're a lot of fun, with overnight sleepers being the norm – a great way to meet locals.</p>
 <p class="info-body-text">Flying around the province can save a lot of time and tickets are often discounted by up to 60%. Be aware that flights can sometimes be cancelled for lack of passengers or due to bad weather, but if you have more money than time, this is a good way to claw some back.</p>
 
 </div>
 <div>
 <h2>Central Xīnjiāng</h2>
 <div>
 
 <p class="flush-left">Bound by deserts and mountain ranges, much of present-day Central Xīnjiāng would have been completely familiar to Silk Road traders on the Northern Route to Kashgar. Today the largest and most important city in the region is Xīnjiāng's capital, Ürümqi, though for travellers the ancient cities around Turpan, the Tianshan mountains, and the Buddha caves of Kuqa are the bigger draws.</p>

 <div>
 <span class="anchor" id="ref-f5148d7adc7d44f146acc0468ec3f2dd"/>
 <p class="flush-left">In Xīnjiāng's capital, Ürümqi (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">乌鲁木齐; </span></span>Wūlǔmùqí), high-rise apartments form a modern skyline that will soon dash any thoughts of spotting wandering camels and ancient caravanserais. The vast majority of its inhabitants are Han Chinese, and the city is one of the least typical of Xīnjiāng, though glimpses of the distant Tiān Shān mountains provide a taste of the extraordinary landscapes awaiting you elsewhere.</p>
 <p class="body-text">As a fast-growing Central Asian hub, the city does business with traders from Běijīng to Baku and plays host to an exotic mix of people. Indeed, it's hard to imagine where else in the world you'll see Chinese, Arabic, Latin and Cyrillic script so commonly side-by-side. This truly is Central Asia.</p>
 <p class="body-text">Ürümqi is not a historic city, but its museum is excellent and there are some atmospheric Uighur districts. Most travellers pass through the provincial capital at some point, and many find their stay to be surprisingly enjoyable.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">Xīnjiāng’s massive provincial museum is a must for Silk Road aficionados. The highlight is the locally famous ‘Loulan Beauty’, the first of half a dozen 3800-year-old desert-mummified bodies of Xīnjiāng's erstwhile Indo-European inhabitants. Other exhibits include some amazing silks, decorative arts, pottery and sculpture, a collection of white jade and an introduction to the traditions of each of the province’s minorities. From the Hóngshān Intersection, take bus 7 for four stops and ask to get off at the museum <em>(bówùguǎn)</em>.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">The Èrdàoqiáo Market and nearby International Bazaar (Guójì Dàbāzhá) have undergone extensive ‘redevelopment’ in recent years and are now aimed more at Chinese tour groups than Uighur traders. Planted in the bazaar is a replica of the Kalon Minaret from Bukhara in Uzbekistan (though the 12th-century original doesn’t have an elevator inside it). The surrounding streets are worth a stroll for their Uighur markets and snack stalls.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">More of an amusement park than a natural wonder, Hóngshān Park is nevertheless a great place to stroll and enjoy the good city views, particularly from the 18th-century hilltop pagoda, which has become something of a city icon. The main southern entrance is to the north of the Xīdàqiáo Intersection – it can be hard to find your way in elsewhere, as the park is fenced off with totalitarian relish.</p>

 <h3>WHICH TIME IS IT?</h3>
 
 <p class="box-flush-left">All of China officially runs on Běijīng time (<em>Běijīng shíjiān</em>). Xīnjiāng, several time zones removed from Běijīng, however, unofficially runs duelling clocks: while the Chinese tend to stick to the official Běijīng time, the locals set their clocks to unofficial Xīnjiāng time (<em>Xīnjiāng shíjiān</em>), two hours behind Běijīng time. Thus 9am Běijīng time is 7am Xīnjiāng time. Most government-run services, such as banks, post offices, bus stations and airlines, run on Běijīng time, generally operating from 10am to 1.30pm and from 4pm to 8pm to cater to the time difference. Uighurs will often automatically use Xīnjiāng time – a political statement as much as anything else – so always double check which clock they're using when making plans!</p>

An airport bus (¥10) runs straight south through town via Hóngshān Intersection to the train station every 30 minutes. In the city centre, an airport shuttle (¥15, free for China Southern passengers) leaves from the Southern Airlines Pearl International Hotel every 30 minutes starting at 7.30am. You’ll need to arrive at least 10 minutes earlier to get a seat.</p>

 <p class="info-body-text">The fastest and most useful buses are the BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) expresses, which dodge traffic by having their very own bus lanes. Sadly they're very hard for travellers to use as maps and signage are posted only in Chinese and Uighur. BRT 1 runs from the railway station to Hóngshān Intersection and then north up Beijing Nanlu. BRT 3 runs from the south bus station to People's Sq and the South Lake Sq. Fares are a flat ¥1, drop a ¥1 note into the box at the ticket gates.</p>

 <p class="info-body-text">Buses stop at major hotels on the way out of the city to pick up passengers before leaving town. In the low season they may not run at all. The return fare is ¥50 and the trip takes about 2½ hours. Expect to stop at several awful tourist shopping traps along the way, to the delight of your fellow travellers. As there is no alternative transport option, unless you hire a driver, you have little choice but to use this service.</p>
 
 
 <p class="info-flush-left">From the main gate (where you purchase a ticket), all travellers must take the park's own bus (¥90, every 10 to 15 minutes) for the 30-minute ride to another parking lot, which itself is still 1km before the lake. You can walk from the final lot or take a shuttle (¥10).</p>

 <p class="flush-left">Turpan (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">吐鲁番; </span></span>Tǔlǔfān) is China’s Death Valley. At 154m below sea level, it’s the second-lowest depression in the world and the hottest spot in China. In July and August, temperatures soar above 40°C and even 50°C, forcing the local population to sleep on their roofs and visiting tourists into a state of semi-torpor.</p>
 <p class="body-text">Despite the heat, the ground water and fertile soil of the Turpan depression has made this a veritable oasis in the desert, evidenced by the nearby centuries-old remains of ancient cities, imperial garrisons and Buddhist caves. The city itself has a mellow vibe to it, and recovering from a day’s sightseeing over a cold Xīnjiāng beer under the grape vines on a warm summer evening is one of the joys of travelling through the province.</p>

Also known as Sūgōng Tǎ after Emin’s son Suleiman, who oversaw its construction (1777–78), its bowling-pin shape is decorated with an interesting mix of geometrical and floral patterns: the former reflect traditional Islamic design, the latter Chinese.

For Dūnhuáng (¥182, 12 hours) in Gānsù, take the afternoon sleeper bus, which originates in Ürümqi and normally arrives in Turpan around 4pm. It's best to buy your ticket for this service a day beforehand, and the route has an unpredictable timetable.</p>

It’s one of the world’s largest (6500 residents once lived here), oldest (1600 years old) and best-preserved ancient cities, inspiring with its scale, setting and palpable historical atmosphere. Get an overview of the site at the central governor’s complex, then continue along the main road past a large monastery to a 'stupa grove' with a 10m-tall pagoda surrounded by 100 smaller pagoda bases.</p>
 
 
 <p class="body-text">While far busier than the similar ruins at Gāochāng, these are definitely the most impressive of the two, mainly due to the sheer number of surviving structures and the dramatic location, on a hillside with dramatic views in all directions. The ruins are 8km west of Turpan and can easily be visited by public transport. Take bus 101 (¥1) to its terminal station Yàěr Xiāng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">亚尔乡</span></span>) and then a minibus (¥2) or taxi (¥15).

 <p class="flush-left">This cave complex, which dates from the 6th to 14th century, has a fine location in a mesmerising desert landscape. Bezeklik means ‘Place of Paintings’ in Uighur and the murals painted in the 11th century represented a high point in Uighur Buddhist art. Sadly, German, Japanese and British teams removed most of the site's distinctive cave art in the early 20th century, and only a few caves can be entered today. However, the location is gorgeous and well worth the trip.</p>

When the 7th-century monk Xuan Zang passed through nearby Subashi, he recorded that two enormous 30m-high Buddha statues flanked Kuqa’s western gate, and that the nearby monasteries housed more than 5000 monks.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">Kuqa's Great Mosque, rebuilt in 1932 on the site of a 16th-century original, is the second largest in Xīnjiāng. (The largest is the <a href="ebook-38-xinjiang-chi15a.xhtml#ref-9661c2f23307b3e20082b8d332a86d48">Id Kah Mosque</a> in Kashgar.) It's a wonderfully quiet and meditative space, with a huge and ornately painted colonnaded prayer hall that makes for a pleasant refuge from the heat of the day. There's a small museum with a gift shop on the premises, too, which is mainly worth peeking into for its interesting old-town views.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">It's quite extraordinary to find this great hostel in fairly remote Kuqa. Run by a young, friendly English-speaking team, it's inside a converted warehouse in a courtyard and is stylishly designed with concrete floors and a minimalist air. The private rooms are all themed, and include a prison cell and a traditional Uighur home, and all rooms have private bathrooms.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">Seventy-five kilometres northwest of Kuqa, this is the largest Buddhist cave-art site in Xīnjiāng. One of the main reasons to come here is for the incredible landscapes you see along the way: bleak and empty jagged mountains on either side of the road make for haunting views. The site itself is impressive, although sadly only a handful of the 236 caves can be visited and the once dazzling wall art has been largely destroyed by 'archaeologists' and religious zealots.</p>
 
 
 <p class="body-text">The interior murals date from the 3rd to the 8th centuries and, as ancient Kuqa was an ethnically diverse place, artisans were inspired by Afghan, Persian and Indian motifs and styles. The heavy use of blue pigment in middle-period murals is a Persian influence, for example, with only the last phase showing any Chinese influence. Each cave is generally built the same way, with two chambers and a central vaulted roof. The roof contains murals of the Buddha's past lives (so-called Jātaka tales) and, unique to Kizil, the pictures are framed in diamond-shaped patterns. Several caves were stripped bare by German archaeologist Albert Von le Coq in the early 20th century, only for the treasures to be destroyed during WWII – as you will hear if you take a free guided tour (in Chinese only). Note the richly decorated roof of Cave 8, where the Buddha's golden robes have been systematically removed over the centuries.</p>
 <p class="body-text">Private transfer is the only way to get here, and a return taxi will cost around ¥250 and takes 90 minutes each way. Most people combine the trip with one to Sūbāshí, even though you have to return to Kuqa between the two sights. Reckon on paying ¥350 for both.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">Sūbāshí was a Buddhist complex that thrived from the 3rd to 13th centuries. It's less visited than other ancient cities in Xīnjiāng, but with its starkly beautiful desert setting, it's worth the trip – Sūbāshí is a 23km trip northeast of Kuga. There are a number of buildings that you visit, though the best preserved one is the pagoda on the far side of the ruins (the main path takes you there), where brickwork and some decoration can still be seen.</p>
 
 
 <p class="body-text">Most people just go to the western complex, with its large central vihara (monastery) and two pagodas, but the dramatic eastern complex across the Kuqa River is worth the hike, though it was being renovated at the time of research. A return taxi to Sūbāshí costs about ¥100; you’ll need to pay extra waiting time if you want to visit the eastern ruins.</p>
