        <h3>Why Go?</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Shaanxi (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">陕西; </span></span>Shǎnxī) is where it began for China. As the heartland of the Qin dynasty (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">秦朝</span></span>), whose warrior emperor united much of China for the first time, Shaanxi was the cradle of Chinese civilisation and the fountainhead of Han culture. Xī’ān marked the beginning and end of the Silk Road and was a buzzing capital long before anyone knew of Běijīng and its Forbidden City.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Shaanxi’s archaeological sites make it an essential destination. Around Xī’ān there’s an excavated Neolithic village and royal graves, including the tomb of Qin Shi Huang and his Army of Terracotta Warriors, one of the world's foremost heritage sites. Shaanxi also serves up some of the most wholesome and appetising food in the land, especially in Xī’ān's Muslim Quarter.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Xī’ān is an emergent travellers' hub, with hotels, restaurants, museums, ancient pagodas, and a marvellous city wall and Muslim Quarter. Rural areas have fascinating villages barely touched by modernity and mountains that were once home to hermits and sages.</p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Around 3000 years ago, the Zhou people of the Bronze Age moved out of their Shaanxi homeland, conquered the Shang and became dominant in much of northern China. Later the state of Qin, ruling from its capital Xiányáng (near modern-day Xī’ān), became the first dynasty to unify much of China. Subsequent dynasties, including the Han, Sui and Tang, were based in Xī’ān, then known as Cháng’ān, which was abandoned for the eastern capital of Luòyáng (in Hénán) whenever invaders threatened.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Shaanxi remained the political heart of China until the 10th century. However, when the imperial court shifted eastward, the province’s fortunes began to decline. Rebellions and famine were followed in 1556 by the deadliest earthquake in history, when an estimated 830,000 people died (the unusually high death toll was attributed to the fact that millions were living in cave homes, which easily collapsed in the quake). The extreme poverty of the region ensured that it was an early stronghold of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party).</p>

        <p class="info-flush-left">Xī’ān has one of China’s best-connected airports. Xī’ān is also a hub for road transport and megahighways spread out in all directions. High-speed trains connect Xī’ān to Běijīng, Shànghǎi and other destinations while long-distance buses link to neighbouring provinces and further afield.</p>
      
      
        <p class="info-flush-left">Regular trains run between Xī'ān and the other main towns in the region. These trips can also be taken by bus.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">Once the terminus of the Silk Road and a melting pot of cultures and religions, as well as home to emperors, courtesans, poets, monks, merchants and warriors, the glory days of Xī’ān (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">西安; </span></span>pronounced 'see-an') may have ended in the early 10th century, but a considerable amount of ancient Cháng’ān, the former city, survives behind the often roaring, modern city. Xī’ān’s Ming-era city walls remain intact, vendors of all descriptions still crowd the narrow lanes of the warren-like Muslim Quarter, and there are enough places of interest to keep even the most amateur historian riveted.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Most people only spend two or three days in Xī’ān; dynastic enthusiasts could easily stay busy for a week. Must-sees include the Army of Terracotta Warriors, the Tomb of Emperor Jingdi, Xī’ān City Walls and the Muslim Quarter, but try to set aside time for its pagodas and museums, plus a side trip to nearby Huá Shān.</p>

                <p class="flush-left">Xī'ān is one of the few cities in China where the imposing old city walls still stand. Built in 1370 during the Ming dynasty, the magnificent 12m-high walls are surrounded by a dry moat and form a rectangle with a perimeter of 14km. Most sections have been restored or rebuilt, and it is possible to walk the walls in their entirety in a leisurely four hours (or around two hours by bike, or at a slow jog).</p>
              
              
                <p class="body-text">Cycling from the South Gate costs ¥40 for 100 minutes (¥200 deposit), while the truly lazy can be whisked around in a golf cart for ¥200. Access ramps are located inside the major gates, with the exception of the South Gate, where the entrance is outside the walls; there's another entrance inside the walls beside the <a href="ebook-23-shaanxi-chi15.xhtml#ref-1287bb35bce61ce57ae027c97e761683">Forest of Stelae Museum</a>. En route, you get to look out over modern-day Xī'ān. From this vantage point it's clear that the city is a hodgepodge of old and new, with the new vastly in the ascendancy. Every now and then a slice of old Xī'ān, such as <a href="ebook-23-shaanxi-chi15.xhtml#ref-24608c9f1e6ba6daebe2964b399bd1ea">Guǎngrén Temple</a>, appears and you are rewarded with a bird's-eye view.</p>
                <p class="body-text">To get an idea of Xī'ān's former grandeur, consider this: the Tang city walls originally enclosed 83 sq km, an area seven times larger than today's city centre.</p>

As a sacred Tibetan Buddhist place of worship, the temple hums with mystery and spiritual energy. Perhaps the most valuable object in the temple resides in the final hall, a golden representation of Sakyamuni that rests upon a Tang dynasty pedestal. There is only one other like it, housed at the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa.</p>

One of China’s best examples of a Tang-style pagoda (squarish rather than round), it was completed in AD 652 to house Buddhist sutras brought back from India by the monk Xuan Zang.

Supposedly built on the site of an ancient wine shop, it was constructed to protect against subterranean divine thunder. Scenes from Taoist mythology are painted around the courtyard. Empress Cixi, the mother of the last emperor, stayed here in 1901 after fleeing Běijīng during the Boxer Rebellion. Bus 502 runs close by the temple (eastbound from Xi Xinjie).</p>

Rooms are well-maintained and decorated in traditional style, including some with <em>kang</em> (heated beds). There's a lovely courtyard and the family rooms with mezzanine are excellent. Staff speak English.</p>

This three-storey warren of shops selling jade, seals, antiques and Mao memorabilia sees far fewer foreign faces than the Muslim Quarter. Dozing street sellers also display their wares south along Shuncheng Donglu (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">顺城东路北段</span></span>).

            <p class="info-flush-left">As an historic city with few attractions for children, Xī'ān can be a challenge for parents. The metro has made getting around town less of a challenge for parents with kids in tow, so use it as much as you can. Prams can be navigated down the road with relative ease. More and more restaurants come with baby chairs, but these can still be hard to find. Baby change facilities will be hard to find in restaurants but easier to find in department stores.</p>
            <p class="info-body-text">Children may find the full-on Terracotta Warrior history tour rather dull, but may enjoy walking around the Xī'ān City Walls or exploring the sights, sounds and aromas of the Muslim Quarter. Consider a side trip to Huá Shān for athletic teenagers keen to burn off calories and tick off some spectacular views.</p>

Pavements frequently have high kerbs and may be littered with obstacles, especially along the smaller back alleys and side streets. Some metro stations have lifts, but not all, and braille is widely used.</p>
            <p class="info-body-text">The Army of the Terracotta Warriors is generally quite accessible, although not everywhere at the site. The Xī'ān City Walls are usually not accessible to those in wheelchairs. Four- and five-star hotels are far better equipped to deal with travellers with disabilities than three-star hotels or hostels.</p>

                <p class="flush-left">The Terracotta Army isn't just Xī'ān's premier sight, it's one of the most famous archaeological finds in the world. This subterranean life-size army of thousands has silently stood guard over the soul of China's first unifier for more than two millennia. Either Qin Shi Huang was terrified of the vanquished spirits awaiting him in the afterlife, or as most archaeologists believe, he expected his rule to continue in death as it had in life.</p>
              
              
                <p class="body-text">Whatever the case, the guardians of his tomb today offer some of the greatest insights we have into the world of ancient China.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The discovery of the army of warriors was entirely fortuitous. In 1974, peasants drilling a well uncovered an underground vault that eventually yielded thousands of terracotta soldiers and horses in battle formation. Throughout the years the site became so famous that many of its unusual attributes are now well known, in particular the fact that no two soldier's faces are alike.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The on-site wrap-around theatre gives a useful primer on how the figures were sculpted. You can also employ a guide (low/high season ¥150/200) or try the audio guide (¥40, plus ¥200 deposit), although the latter is somewhat useless, being difficult to understand and not very compelling.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Then visit the site in reverse, which enables you to build up to the most impressive pit for a fitting finale.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Start with the smallest pit, <strong>Pit 3</strong>, containing 72 warriors and horses; it's believed to be the army headquarters due to the number of high-ranking officers unearthed here. It's interesting to note that the northern room would have been used to make sacrificial offerings before battle. In the next pit, <strong>Pit 2</strong>, containing around 1300 warriors and horses, you can examine five of the soldiers up close: a kneeling archer, a standing archer, a cavalryman and his horse, a mid-ranking officer and a general. The level of detail is extraordinary: the expressions, hairstyles, armour and even the tread on the footwear are all unique.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The largest pit, <strong>Pit 1</strong>, is the most imposing. Housed in a building the size of an aircraft hangar, it is believed to contain 6000 warriors (only 2000 are on display) and horses, all facing east and ready for battle. The vanguard of three rows of archers (both crossbow and longbow) is followed by the main force of soldiers, who originally held spears, swords, dagger-axes and other long-shaft weapons. The infantry were accompanied by 35 chariots, though these, made of wood, have long since disintegrated.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Almost as extraordinary as the soldiers is a pair of bronze chariots and horses unearthed just 20m west of the Tomb of Qin Shi Huang. These are now on display, together with some of the original weaponry and a mid-ranking officer you can see up close in a huge modern museum called the <strong>Qin Shi Huang Emperor Tomb Artefact Exhibition Hall</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">秦始皇帝陵文物陈列厅; </span></span>Qǐnshǐhuángdìlíng Chénliètīng).</p>
                <p class="body-text">You can take photographs, although signs forbid using flash photography (widely ignored) or tripods (also ignored by some).</p>
                <p class="body-text">Among rather tacky souvenir offerings, you can get your own warrior statue personalised with your own face (¥100) or have a photo taken next to a fake warrior (¥10). You can also pick up all manner of terracotta ornamentation – from warrior paperweights to life-size statues – from the souvenir shop in the theatre building. There's also a <strong>Friendship Store</strong> for jade, jewellery and so forth.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The Army of the Terracotta Warriors is easily reached by public bus. From Xī'ān train station take one of the air-conditioned buses, either 914 or 915 (¥8, one hour), which depart every four minutes from 6am to 7pm. Take the bus to the last stop; the buses also travel via the Huáqīng Hot Springs and the Tomb of Qin Shi Huang. The car park for the vehicles is a 15-minute walk from the site, but you can take an electric buggy (¥5) instead if you want. If you want to eat here, there's a good cafe in the theatre building and after you exit to walk back to the car and bus park, you will take another route past a whole assortment of restaurants and fast food, including a McDonald's. Buses head back to town from the parking lot.</p>

                <p class="flush-left">In its time this tomb must have been one of the grandest mausoleums the world had ever seen. Historical accounts describe it as containing palaces filled with precious stones, underground rivers of mercury and ingenious defences against intruders. The tomb reputedly took 38 years to complete, and required a workforce of 700,000 people. It is said that the artisans who built it were buried alive within, taking its secrets with them.</p>
              
              
                <p class="body-text">Archaeologists have yet to enter the tomb but probes and sensors have been sent inside. Levels of mercury inside exceed 100 times normal concentrations, temptingly adding credence to some of the legends. Since little has been excavated there isn’t much to see but you can climb the steps to the top of the 76m-high mound for a fine view of the surrounding countryside.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The Terracotta Warriors bus from Xī’ān train station stops at the tomb, which is 2km west of the warriors.</p>

                <p class="flush-left">Dating way back to the 2nd century AD, this temple was built to house parts of a sacred finger bone of the Buddha, presented to China by India’s King Asoka who undertook the distribution of Sakyamuni's relics. The older section is worth a visit and you can join the queue of pilgrims who shuffle past the finger bone. The real reason to make the trip out here is the superb <strong>museum</strong> and its collection of Tang-dynasty treasures.</p>
              
              
                <p class="body-text">There are elaborate gold and silver boxes (stacked on top of one another to form pagodas) and tiny crystal and jade coffins that originally contained the four separated sections of the holy finger.</p>
                <p class="body-text">In 1981, after torrential rains had weakened the temple’s ancient brick structure, the entire western side of its 12-storey pagoda collapsed. The subsequent restoration of the temple produced a sensational discovery. Below the pagoda in a sealed crypt were more than 1000 sacrificial objects and royal offerings – all forgotten for over a millennium.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Sensing a cash cow, local authorities began enlarging the temple complex and it now includes a sprawling modern section featuring a 1.6km-long walkway lined with 10 golden Buddhas, eccentric modern sculptures and outsized gates. Shuttle buses (¥20) whisk the pious to the main temple, topped with an enormous replica of the box in which the finger bone was kept. Despite the overblown enlargements, for Buddhists this is a very sacred place.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Other notable exhibits are ornate incense burners, glass cups and vases from the Roman Empire, statues, gold and silver offerings, and an excellent reproduced cross-section of the four-chamber crypt, which symbolised a tantric mandala (a geometric representation of the universe).</p>
                <p class="body-text">Reaching Fǎmén Temple is quite an expedition, but direct buses head to the sacred site 115km northwest of town. Tour bus 2 (¥25, 8am) from Xī’ān train station runs to the temple and returns to Xī’ān at 5pm. The temple is also generally included on Western Tours.</p>

                <p class="flush-left">This tomb, also referred to as the Han Jing Mausoleum, Liu Qi Mausoleum and Yangling Mausoleum, is the burial place of the Han-dynasty emperor Jingdi (188–141 BC) and is quite possibly Xī’ān’s most underrated highlight. If you only have time for two sights outside Xī'ān, make it the Army of Terracotta Warriors and this impressive museum and tomb. Unlike the warriors, though, it's not inundated with visitors so you'll have elbow room to fully appreciate what you’re seeing.</p>
              
              
                <p class="body-text">Much influenced by Taoist precepts, Emperor Jingdi based his rule upon the concept of <em>wúwéi</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">无为; </span></span>nonaction or noninterference) and did much to improve the life of his subjects: he lowered taxes greatly, used diplomacy to cut back on unnecessary military expeditions and even ameliorated punishments meted out to criminals. The contents of his tomb are particularly interesting, as they reveal more about daily life than martial preoccupations – a total contrast with the Terracotta Army.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The site has been divided into two sections: the museum and the excavation area. The <strong>museum</strong> holds a large display of expressive terracotta figurines (more than 50,000 were buried here), including eunuchs, servants, domesticated animals and even female cavalry on horseback. The figurines originally had movable wooden arms (now gone) and were dressed in colourful silk robes.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Inside the <strong>tomb</strong> are 21 narrow pits, some of which have been covered by a glass floor, allowing you to walk over the top of ongoing excavations and get a great view of the relics. In all, 81 burial pits are believed to be here.</p>
                <p class="body-text">To get here, take Xī’ān metro Line 2 to the station Shitushuguan. Outside exit D take bus 4 (¥1) to the tomb, which leaves at 8.30am, 9.30am, 10.30am, noon, 1.30pm, 3pm, 4pm and 5pm, returning to the Xī’ān metro station at 9am, noon, 4pm and 5pm.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Alternatively, tours (around ¥160 per person) are usually arranged by guesthouses. The tomb is 20 minutes from the airport, so makes an easy stop-off by taxi.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">One of Taoism’s five sacred mountains, the granite domes of Huá Shān (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">华山</span></span>) used to be home to hermits, sages and Taoist mystics (some of whom could fly, they say). These days, though, the trails that wind their way up to the five peaks are populated by droves of day-trippers drawn by the dreamy scenery. And it is spectacular. There are knife-blade ridges and twisted pine trees poking from crevices and clinging to ledges, while the summits offer transcendent panoramas of green mountains and countryside stretching away to the horizon. Taoists hoping to find a quiet spot to contemplate the <em>dào</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">道</span></span>) may be disappointed, but everyone else seems to revel in the tough climb and those who overnight can bask in the first glow of sunrise.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">There are three ways up the mountain to the <strong>North Peak</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">北峰; </span></span>Běi Fēng), the first of five summit peaks. Two of these options start from the eastern base of the mountain, at the North Peak cable-car terminus. The first option is handy if you don’t fancy the climb: an Austrian-built <span class="anchor" id="ref-8456f3bc3d5b830a7ff0362145ecd7fc"/><span class="name">cable car</span> <span class="practicalities">(</span><span class="practicalities"><span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">北峰索道; </span></span>Běifēng Suǒdào</span> <span class="map-links">

          <p class="body-text">The second option is to work your way to the North Peak under the cable-car route. This takes two sweaty hours, and two sections of 50m or so are literally vertical, with nothing but a steel chain to grab onto and tiny chinks cut into the rock for footing. It's why this route is called the ‘Soldiers Path'.</p>
          <p class="body-text">The third option is the most popular, but it’s still hard work, taking between three and five hours. A 6km path leads to the North Peak from the village of Huá Shān, at the base of the mountain (the other side of the mountain from the cable car). It's pretty easy for the first 4km, but after that it’s all steep stairs.</p>
          <p class="body-text">The village at the trailhead is a good place to stock up on water and snacks; these are also available at shops on the trail but prices double and triple the further you head up the mountain. No need to fork out for the white cotton gloves purveyed by loud old ladies; they insist the rust on the chains at the steepest sections will come off on your hands, but in our experience this was not the case.</p>
          <p class="body-text">If you want to carry on to the other peaks, then count on a minimum of eight hours in total from the base of Huá Shān. If you want to spare your knees, you can take the cable car to the North Peak and then climb to the other peaks, before ending up back where you started. It takes about four to five hours to complete the circuit in this fashion, and it’s still fairly strenuous and some sections are exhausting. In places, it can be a little nerve-racking, too. Huá Shān has a reputation for being dangerous, especially when the trails are crowded, or if it’s wet or icy, so exercise caution.</p>

          <p class="body-text">The South Peak is the highest at 2160m and the most crowded. The East Peak isn't as busy, but all three rear peaks afford great views when the weather cooperates. If possible, avoid weekends when foot traffic is heaviest.</p>

Thankfully, the admission fee includes a harness and karabiners that you lock onto cables, but even with these safety features it’s scary as hell. At peak times, and even in the slow season, queues can get seriously long here.</p>
          <p class="body-text">There is accommodation on the mountain, most of it basic and overpriced, but it does allow you to start climbing in the afternoon, watch the sunset and then spend the night, before catching the sunrise from either the East Peak or South Peak. Some locals make the climb at night, using torches (flashlights) and some of the paths are illuminated. The idea is to start around 11pm and be at the East Peak for sunrise; you get to see the scenery on the way down.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Admission is ¥180 (students ¥90).</p>

It's best to phone ahead to check on room availability and prices on the mountain, but you'll probably need a Chinese speaker. Mountain hotels are basic, with no showers and shared bathrooms.</p>
          <p class="body-text">In the village, there are a couple of hostels and other cheapies, plus some decent hotels. Most shops have basic, budget rooms.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">Hánchéng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">韩城</span></span>) is best known for being the hometown of Sima Qian (145–90 BC), China’s legendary historian and author of the <em>Shiji</em> (Records of the Grand Historian). Sima Qian chronicled different aspects of life in the Han dynasty and set about arranging the country’s already distant past in its proper (Confucian) order. He was eventually castrated and imprisoned by Emperor Wudi, after having defended an unsuccessful general.</p>
          <p class="body-text">For its historical textures and ambience, Hánchéng is a great side trip from Xī’ān. Built upon a hill, the new town (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">新城; </span></span><em>xīnchéng</em>) located at the top is dusty and unremarkable and is where you’ll find hotels, banks and transport. But the more atmospheric old town (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">古城; </span></span><em>gǔchéng</em>) at the bottom of the hill boasts a handful of historic sights. The unique Ming-dynasty village of Dǎngjiācūn is 9km further east.</p>

              <p class="flush-left">This lovely and perfectly preserved, 14th-century village nestles in a sheltered location in a loess valley. Once the home of the Dang clan (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">党家</span></span>), successful merchants who ferried timber and other goods across the Yellow River, it has since evolved into a quintessential farming community. The village is home to 125 grey-brick courtyard houses, which are notable for their carvings and mix of different architectural styles. The elegant six-storey tower is a <strong>Confucian Hall</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">文星阁; </span></span>Wénxīng Gé).</p>
            
            
              <p class="body-text">As with so many small villages, many of the families have moved out and their homes are now exhibition showrooms, so the village feels rather lifeless. However, it’s well worth a wander to explore the old alleys and admire the historic architecture.</p>
              <p class="body-text">Dǎngjiācūn is 9km northeast of Hánchéng. To get here, take a minibus (¥4, 20 minutes) from the bus station to the entrance road, from where it’s a pleasant 2km walk through fields to the village. A taxi from Hánchéng is another option (¥35 to ¥40).</p>

The weathered Yuan, Ming and Qing buildings give an understated sense of how long they have stood the test of time, along with the dramatic towering cypress trees (often associated with Confucian sites), half-moon pool and glazed dragon screens.

Despite all the construction, there’s enough interesting stuff to make this a good place to break a trip if you’re following the Great Wall, heading north on the trail of Genghis Khan or wandering west to the Hui culture of Yínchuān.
