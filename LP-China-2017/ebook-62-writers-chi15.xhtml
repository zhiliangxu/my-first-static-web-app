In 1972 that’s all Tony and Maureen Wheeler needed for the trip of a lifetime – across Europe and Asia overland to Australia. It took several months, and at the end – broke but inspired – they sat at their kitchen table writing and stapling together their first travel guide, <em>Across Asia on the Cheap</em>. Within a week they’d sold 1500 copies. Lonely Planet was born.</p><p class="body-text">Today, Lonely Planet has offices in Franklin, London, Melbourne, Oakland, Beijing and Delhi, with more than 600 staff and writers. We share Tony’s belief that ‘a great guidebook should do three things: inform, educate and amuse’.</p></div><h1 id="ref-our-writers">Our Writers</h1>
