          <p class="flush-left">Mongolia. The name alone stirs up visions of nomadic herders, thundering horses and, of course, the warrior-emperor Genghis Khan.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Travellers heading north of the Great Wall might half expect to see the Mongol hordes galloping through the vast grasslands. The reality is rather different: 21st-century Inner Mongolia (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">内蒙古; </span></span>Nèi Měnggǔ) is a wholly different place from Mongolia itself. The more-visited south of the province is industrialised, prosperous and very much within the realm of China’s modern economic miracle. Having said that, Inner Mongolia is more than nine times the size of England and the Mongolia of your dreams can be found off the tourist route, amid the shimmering sand dunes of the Badain Jaran Desert or the vast grasslands in the north. Some effort is required to reach these areas, but the spectacular scenery can make it an unforgettable journey.</p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">The nomadic tribes of the northern steppes have always been at odds with the agrarian Han Chinese, so much so that the Great Wall was built to keep them out. But it acted more like a speed bump than an actual barrier to the Mongol hordes.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Genghis Khan and grandson Kublai rumbled through in the 13th century, and after conquering southern China in 1279 Kublai Khan became the first emperor of the Yuan dynasty. But by the end of the 14th century the Mongol empire had collapsed, and the Mongols again became a collection of disorganised roaming tribes. It was not until the 18th century that the Qing emperors finally gained full control of the region.</p>
        <p class="body-text">A divide-and-conquer policy by the Qing led to the creation of an ‘Inner’ and ‘Outer’ Mongolia. The Qing opened up Inner Mongolia to Han farmers, and waves of migrants came to cultivate the land. Outer Mongolia was spared this policy and, with backing from the USSR, it gained full independence in 1921.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Now Mongolians make up only 15% of Inner Mongolia’s population. Most of the other 85% are Han Chinese, with a smattering of Hui, Manchu, Daur and Ewenki.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Inner Mongolia’s economy boomed in recent years thanks to extensive mining of both coal and rare earth minerals. That growth came at great environmental cost. The mines swallowed up pastureland at alarming rates and desertification has been the root cause of the dust storms that envelop Běijīng each spring. Only the far north of the region, where the economy is largely based on cattle ranching and tourism, has escaped heavy industrialisation.</p>

    <div class="history">
      <h3>Climate</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Siberian blizzards and cold air currents rake the Mongolian plains from November to March. June to August brings pleasant temperatures, but the west is scorching hot during the day.</p>
        <p class="body-text">The best time to visit is between July and September, particularly to see the grasslands, which are green only in summer. Make sure you bring warm, windproof clothing, as even in midsummer it’s often windy, and evening temperatures can dip to 10°C or below.</p>
      
    </div>
    <div class="history">
      <h3>Language</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">The Mongolian language is part of the Altaic linguistic family, which includes the Central Asian Turkic languages and the now defunct Manchurian. Although the vertical Mongolian script (written left to right) adorns street signs, almost everyone speaks standard Mandarin.</p>

        <p class="info-flush-left">Inner Mongolia borders Mongolia and Russia. There are border crossings at Erenhot (Mongolia) and Mǎnzhōulǐ (Russia), which are stopovers on the Trans-Mongolian and Trans-Manchurian Railways, respectively. To Mongolia, you can also catch a local train to Erenhot, cross the border and take another local train to Ulaanbaatar (with the appropriate visa). Possible air connections include Hohhot to Ulaanbaatar or Hǎilā’ěr to Ulaanbaatar and Choibalsan (eastern Mongolia). The far west of Inner Mongolia has opened up to air travel with the opening of airports at Éjìnà Qí, Āláshàn Yòuqí and Bayanhot, making transport to the region far easier.</p>
        <p class="info-body-text">Trains and long-distance buses reach Hohhot, Baōtóu and other large towns from neighbouring provinces.</p>

      <p class="info-heading-1 getting-around"><samp class="font-icon">8</samp>Getting Around</p>
      
        <p class="info-flush-left">Inner Mongolia is vast and stupendously long from east to west, so you may find yourself flying at least once, especially when accessing the northeast of the province and the far west. Otherwise you'll be relying on a mixture of trains and long-distance buses. The far west of Inner Mongolia has no rail line, so you'll have to either fly or take long-distance buses.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">Founded by Altan Khan in the 16th century, the good-looking capital of Inner Mongolia is an increasingly prosperous city. Hohhot (known in Mandarin as <span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">呼和浩特</span></span><em>;</em> Hūhéhàotè) means ‘Blue City’ in Mongolian, a reference to the arching blue skies over the grasslands. Streets are attractively tree-lined (although the roads are traffic-snarled) and there are some truly astonishing Tibetan Buddhist temples in town – more than enough to keep you busy for a day or two before heading to the hinterlands. Helpfully, most of the sights congregate in the same part of town, making sightseeing a doddle. Note that the cumbersome name of the city is often colloquially shortened to <span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">呼市 </span></span>(Hūshì).</p>

              <p class="flush-left">This spectacular Tibetan Buddhist temple is the oldest and largest temple in the city. Also called 'Immeasurable Temple' (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">无量寺; </span></span>Wúliàng Sì) in Chinese, the complex was originally built in the 16th century and much enhanced in the following century. A very sacred place and a fascinating introduction to the mysterious ways of Tibetan Buddhism, Dà Zhào attracts pilgrims from across the land, who prostrate themselves fully in prayer on boards in front of the magnificent altars through the temple.</p>
            
            
              <p class="body-text">Look for the amazing-looking and blue-faced <strong>Medicine Buddha</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">药师佛; </span></span>Yàoshī Fó) seated in his namesake hall and garbed in the most astonishing fashion. Also seek out the many-armed golden deity in the esoteric <strong>Mìzōng Hùfǎ Hall</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">密宗护法殿; </span></span>Mìzōng Hùfǎ Diàn), the central tantric deity within the <strong>Shènglè Jīngāng Hall</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">胜乐金刚殿; </span></span>Shènglè Jīngāng Diàn) and the huge jade Buddha residing in the <strong>Jade Buddha Hall</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">玉佛殿; </span></span>Yùfó Diàn). The temple is also home to a 2.55m silver effigy of Sakyamuni, contained within the <strong>Buddha Hall</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">佛堂; </span></span>Fótáng). In other halls, pilgrims walk in clockwise fashion around altars, twirling prayer wheels, lost in prayer.</p>
              <p class="body-text">The plaza south of the temple is popular with kite-flyers and is great for people-watching. There's an attractive decorative archway and a vast statue of Altan Khan (1507–82), the Mongol founder of the city and ruler who began building the temple.</p>

              <p class="flush-left">Rising up at the rear of the Five Pagoda Temple, this striking, Indian-influenced, five-tiered pagoda was completed in 1732. Its main claim to fame is the Mongolian <strong>star chart</strong> around the back (protected behind glass), though the engraving of the Diamond Sutra (in Sanskrit, Tibetan and Mongolian), extending around the entire base of the structure, is in much better condition. Another fascinating aspect of the temple is the 'Temple Culture Exhibition of Hohhot' Hall, containing a mesmerising array of <strong>tantric statues</strong>.</p>

The trains are the Chinese-owned K3 (hard/soft sleeper/deluxe ¥1222/1723/1884, 30 hours) and the Mongolian-owned K23 (hard/deluxe sleeper ¥1259/1849). You need to buy tickets from CITS (China International Travel Service) in Běijīng, not from the train station. The same train stops in Erenhot (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">二连浩特; </span></span>Èrliánhàotè; hard sleeper ¥130, 10½ hours), at the Mongolian border.

            <p class="box-body-text">There are also five daily buses from Hohhot to Erenhot (¥95, six hours), leaving between 8am and 1.30pm; as they depart more regularly, buses are more practical than the train, although the overnight train at 11.52pm is very useful. From Erenhot you can catch a jeep across the border (about ¥60) and continue to Ulaanbaatar on the daily 5.50pm local train.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">A train also runs from Hohhot to Ulaanbaatar on Monday and Friday, leaving at 10.50pm and taking 30 hours. Two trains run from Hohhot to Erenhot: the 6856 (hard seat ¥54) departs at 9.58am and arrives in Erenhot at 6.28pm; the overnight T4202 (hard/soft sleeper ¥146/222) from Bāotóu leaves Hohhot at 11.52pm, pulling into Erenhot at 6.40am.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">To fly from Hohhot to Ulaanbaatar, you need to go via Beijing, where Air China (¥2500) and <span>Aero Mongolia</span> (¥1630) have flights to Ulaanbaatar. Book online at <a href="http://www.ctrip.com">www.ctrip.com</a>. Flights can be reduced in winter.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">The 'very fine marble palace' described by explorer Marco Polo and eulogised and immortalised by poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge as a 'stately pleasure-dome' is today little more than a vast prairie with vague remnants of its once mighty walls, but it continues to have an allure that is far greater than the sum of its remaining parts.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Today Xanadu, or Shàngdū (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">上都</span></span>) as it was actually called, is accessed via the small gateway town of Zhènglánqí (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">正蓝旗</span></span>).</p>
        
        
          <p class="body-text">Conceived by Kublai Khan, grandson of Genghis and the first Yuan emperor, Shàngdū’s lifespan as the summer capital was relatively brief. Construction of the city started in 1252 and lasted four years, serving as Kublai Khan's summer palace away from his palace in Zhongdu (Khanbaliq), the Yuan dynasty capital in today's Běijīng. Shàngdū was overrun and destroyed by Ming forces in 1369.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Shàngdū actually consisted of three distinct cities: the outer city, the imperial city and the palace city. All that is visible now are the outer and inner walls, which are ticketed (admission ¥30). The site was listed as a Unesco World Heritage site in June 2012.</p>
        
        
          <p class="body-text">From the yurt where you buy your ticket, it’s another 1.5km to the outer walls (a golf buggy will take you for ¥10 or you can rent a bicycle for ¥10). From there, you can walk another 500m to the inner ramparts. Paths through the wildflower-covered grassland that has swallowed up the city offer the chance for pleasant strolls and reflective musings on the vagaries of history.</p>

Unfortunately, old Genghis Khan (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">成吉思汗; </span></span>Chéngjí Sīhàn) is not buried here (his resting place has never been found). Instead, the mausoleum’s existence is justified by an old Mongol tradition of worshipping Genghis Khan’s personal effects, including his saddle, bow and other items.

By then, most of the relics had been lost or stolen (everything you’ll see here is a replica). But even today, some of the guards at the site still claim descent from the Darhat clan.

Legend has it that the slaves who built his tomb were massacred afterwards by soldiers, who were then subsequently killed themselves to prevent anyone knowing the location of his grave. Archaeologists hunting for Genghis’ final resting place have been further hampered by a reputed curse that has supposedly struck some down. Most historians assume that after his death (and no one knows where that occurred) in 1227, Genghis’ body was taken back to Mongolia and buried near his birthplace in Khentii Aimag close to the Onon River.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">Northern Inner Mongolia's largest city, Hǎilā’ěr (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">海拉尔</span></span>) is a busy, rather ordinary place. Don't fret, the city isn't the draw: surrounding the town range the expansive Hūlúnbèi’ěr Grasslands, a vast prairie that begins just outside the city and rolls northwards towards the Russian and Mongolian borders, seemingly forever. Superbly lush and deeply verdent come July and August, the grasslands are a fantastic sight and <em>the</em> place in Inner Mongolia to saddle up a horse.</p>
          <p class="body-text">The immediate area around Hǎilā’ěr sees several inevitably touristy yurt camps where you can eat, listen to traditional music and sometimes stay the night. Although they’re not places where Mongolians actually live, you can still learn a bit about Mongolian culture, and the wide-open grasslands are a gorgeous setting.</p>
          <p class="body-text">For a more authentic experience, travel further away, although staying with local families in the grasslands is not easy to organise unless you speak some Mandarin (or Mongolian).</p>

Bring along binoculars if you want to have a closer look at the Russian villages across the border.</p>

You can pass an hour or so looking around and sipping milk tea, spend the day horse riding (per hour ¥200) or hiking, or come for an evening of dinner, singing and dancing.</p>

To get here, you’ll have to hire a taxi from Hǎilā’ěr (about ¥300 return) or join one of the Chinese group tours (sign up at your hotel or at the booth at the Hǎilā’ěr train station).</p>
              <p class="body-text">About 2km before the main camp there are a couple of unsigned family-run camps. Prices for food, accommodation and horse rental are about half what you pay at Jīnzhànghàn, but they are rather less organised. To skip the tourist-run camps, push further north through the grasslands towards Ēnhé and Shì Wěi.</p>

Shì Wěi itself is no longer the backwater it once was and the commercial summer tourist season gets busy with domestic visitors, although very few foreigners make it up here, especially out of season. But it’s fun to ride a horse along the riverbank (¥40 per half-hour) while gazing at the Russian village on the opposite bank, or sitting down to some Russian food. Look for wooden stages on both sides of the river: each country used to host performances for their neighbours!

At its height, some 2000 monks lived here. So important was the monastery that the main prayer hall, Gandan Danjaling Sum, contains the remains of the sixth Dalai Lama inside the golden stupa that dominates it.</p>
              
              
                <p class="body-text">Tragically, the monastery was demolished during the Cultural Revolution; a 1957 photo in the main prayer hall gives you an idea of how big it once was. The temples have since been rebuilt, but in the last couple of years a hotel, yurt restaurants and a supremely tacky shopping street have been added to the complex to entice domestic tour groups here.</p>
                <p class="body-text">There are good walking trails in the mountains behind the complex; take the path to the right of the main temple and follow it for one hour to a grassy plateau with fantastic views.</p>
                <p class="body-text">From Bayanhot, a taxi to the monastery and back is around ¥150, but the driver may not want to wait for long (in this case he will naturally charge more). If going on to Yínchuān (your taxi driver can drop you at the highway where you can stop any Yínchuān-bound bus), look out for the crumbling, yet still mighty, remains of the Great Wall at <strong>Sānguānkǒu</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">三关口</span></span>).

The <strong>Hall of the Three Buddhas</strong> is an authentic and dusty shrine housing its namesake trinity of Buddha in various incarnations, while the <strong>Money God Temple</strong>, in one of the side halls, sees the shining Money God himself, flanked by ferocious Tibetan Buddhist deities, gazing out over flickering, burning wicks suspended in oil.</p>
