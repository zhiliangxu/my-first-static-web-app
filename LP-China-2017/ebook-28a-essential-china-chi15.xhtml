    <h2>Cuisine</h2>
    
      <p class="introduction-flush-left">To the Chinese, food is life. Dining is the cherished high point of the daily social calendar and often the one occasion to stop work and fully relax. The only problem is knowing where to begin: the sheer variety on offer can have your head spinning and your tummy quivering.</p>
    
    <div>
      <h3>Peking Duck</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Purists insist you must be in Běijīng for true Peking duck roasted to an amber hue over fruit-tree wood. You might as well take their advice as that’s where you’ll find the best Peking-duck restaurants.</p>
      
      <div class="context-eps"><img alt="280909904jpg" src="images/280909904.jpg"/></div><div class="caption"><span>Peking duck | </span><span>VSL/SHUTTERSTOCK ©</span></div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Dumplings</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Set your compass north and northeast for the best <em>jiǎozi (</em>dumplings) <em>–</em> leek, pork, lamb, crabmeat wrapped in an envelope of dough. If you like them crispy, get them <em>guōtiē</em> (fried). Shànghǎi’s interpretation is <em>xiǎolóngbāo</em> – scrummy and steamed.</p>

    <div>
      <h3>Noodles</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Marco Polo may have nicked the recipe to make spaghetti (so they say), but he didn’t quite get the flavouring right. Noodles range across an exciting spectrum of taste, from the wincingly spicy <em>dàndan miàn</em> (spicy noodles) through to the supersalty <em>zhájiàng miàn</em> (fried sauce noodles).</p>

    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Dim Sum</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Dim sum is steamed up across China, but like the Cantonese dialect, it’s best left to the masters of the south to get it right. Hong Kong, Macau and Guǎngzhōu should be your first stops – they set the dim sum benchmark.</p>

    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Hotpot</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">An all-weather meal, hotpot is ideal for banishing the bitter cold of a northern winter, while in steaming Chóngqìng old folk devour the spiciest variety in the height of summer.</p>

    <h2>Hiking</h2>
    
      <p class="introduction-flush-left">If you’re keen to escape the cities into the great outdoors, China’s dramatic variety of landscapes is the perfect backdrop for bracing walks – whether island-hopping in Hong Kong, exploring the foothills of the Himalayas or trekking through gorges in Yúnnán province.</p>
    
    <div>
      <h3>Hong Kong’s Outlying Islands &amp; New Territories</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">A whopping 70% of Hong Kong is hiking territory, so fling off your Gucci loafers, lace up your hiking boots and go from island to island or make a break for the New Territories, where fantastic hiking trails await.</p>
      
      <div class="context-eps"><img alt="gettyrf575367703jpg" src="images/gettyrf_575367703.jpg"/></div><div class="caption"><span>Hong Kong’s New Territories | </span><span>KAY DULAY/GETTY IMAGES ©</span></div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Huángshān, Ānhuī</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Sooner or later you’ll have to hike uphill, and where better than up China’s most beautiful mountain. The steps may be punishing, but just focus on the scenery: even if the fabled mists are nowhere to be seen, the views are incredible.</p>
      
      <div class="context-eps"><img alt="shutterstock451758946jpg" src="images/shutterstock_451758946.jpg"/></div><div class="caption"><span>Huángshān | </span><span>APHOTOSTORY/SHUTTERSTOCK ©</span></div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Yángshuò, Guǎngxī</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Yángshuò’s karst topography is truly astonishing. Base yourself in town, give yourself three or four days, and walk your socks off (or hire a bike). Adventurous types can even try rock climbing.</p>
      
      <div class="context-eps"><img alt="gettyrf597660095jpg" src="images/gettyrf_597660095.jpg"/></div><div class="caption"><span>Rock climbing, Yángshuò | </span><span>HENN PHOTOGRAPHY/GETTY IMAGES ©</span></div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Tiger Leaping Gorge, Yúnnán</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">The mother of all southwest China’s treks, this magnificently named Yúnnán hike is at its most picturesque in early summer. It’s not a walk in the park, so plan ahead and give yourself enough time.</p>
      
      <div class="context-eps"><img alt="162477759jpg" src="images/162477759.jpg"/></div><div class="caption"><span>Jīnshā River, Tiger Leaping Gorge | </span><span>FENG WEI PHOTOGRAPHY/GETTY IMAGES ©</span></div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Ganden to Samye, Tibet</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">You’ll need four to five days for this glorious high-altitude hike connecting two of Tibet’s most splendid monasteries. The landscape is beautiful, but the trek requires preparation both physically and mentally, plus a Tibet travel permit.</p>

    <h2>Temples</h2>
    
      <p class="introduction-flush-left">Divided between Buddhist, Taoist and Confucian faiths, China’s temples are places of introspection, peace and absolution. Find them on mountain peaks, in caves, on side streets, hanging from cliffsides or occupying the epicentre of town, from Tibet to Běijīng and beyond.</p>
    
    <div>
      <h3>Pǔníng Temple, Chéngdé</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">On a clear day this temple stands out against the hills around Chéngdé, while in the Mahayana Hall is the Guanyin statue, a 22m-high, multiarmed embodiment of Buddhist benevolence – this is perhaps China’s most astonishing statue.</p>
      
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Confucius Temple, Qūfù</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">This is China’s largest and most important Confucius Temple. The Shāndōng sage has had an immeasurable influence on the Chinese persona through the millennia – visit the town where it began and try to put his teachings in perspective.</p>
      
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Temple of Heaven, Běijīng</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Not really a temple, but let’s not quibble. Běijīng’s Temple of Heaven was China’s graceful place of worship for the Ming and Qing emperors, encapsulating the Confucian desire for symmetry and order, and harmony between heaven and earth.</p>
      
      <div class="context-eps"><img alt="shutterstock480262195jpg" src="images/shutterstock_480262195.jpg"/></div><div class="caption"><span>Temple of Heaven, Běijīng | </span><span>ZHAO JIAN KANG/SHUTTERSTOCK ©</span></div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Labrang Monastery, Xiàhé</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">If it’s a hassle to rustle up a Tibet travel permit, pop down to this gargantuan Tibetan monastery in the scenic southwest corner of Gānsù. Its aura of devotion is amplified by the nonstop influx of Tibetan pilgrims and worshippers.</p>
      
      <div class="context-eps"><img alt="shutterstock122596336jpg" src="images/shutterstock_122596336.jpg"/></div><div class="caption"><span>Labrang Monastery, Xiàhé | </span><span>BEIBAOKE/SHUTTERSTOCK ©</span></div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Jokhang Temple, Lhasa</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Tibet’s holiest place of worship, the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa is a place of pilgrimage for every Tibetan Buddhist at least once in their lifetime.</p>
      
      <div class="context-eps"><img alt="319292819jpg" src="images/319292819.jpg"/></div><div class="caption"><span>Mandala, Jokhang Temple | </span><span>CHENALLEN/SHUTTERSTOCK ©</span></div>

    <h2>Festivals</h2>
    
      <p class="introduction-flush-left">China is a nation of hard workers and entrepreneurs, but considerable energy is reserved for its festivals and celebrations. Festivals can be religious, fun-filled, commemorative or seasonal. Locals don their best clothes and get seriously sociable. Join in and be part of the party.</p>
    
    <div>
      <h3>Dragon Boat Festival</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Commemorating the death of Qu Yuan, the celebrated third century BC poet and statesman, dramatic dragon boat races can be seen in May or June churning up the waterways across China, including in Shànghǎi, Hong Kong and Tiānjīn.</p>
      
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Ice and Snow Festival, Harbin</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">The arctic temperatures may knock the wind from your lungs, but in January the frost-bitten capital of Hēilóngjiāng province twinkles with an iridescent collection of carved ice sculptures.</p>
      
      <div class="context-eps"><img alt="gettyrf166622760jpg" src="images/gettyrf_166622760.jpg"/></div><div class="caption"><span>Ice &amp; Snow Festival, Harbin | </span><span>ERIC HEVESY/GETTY IMAGES ©</span></div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Third Moon Fair, Dàlǐ</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">One of China’s many ethnic minority festivals, and usually held in April, this Bai festival commemorates the appearance of Guanyin, the Bodhisattva of Mercy, to the people of the Nanzhao kingdom.</p>
      
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Spring Festival</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">China’s most commercially driven and full-on celebration takes the entire nation by storm at midnight on the first day of the first lunar month. The fuse is lit on a nationwide arsenal of fireworks.</p>
      
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Monlam (Great Prayer) Festival, Xiàhé</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Celebrated across Tibet, the highlight of this Buddhist festival (in February or March) is easiest to witness in the monastic town of Xiàhé, where a host of celebrations include the unfurling of a huge <em>thangka</em> (sacred painting) on the hillside.</p>
