        <h3>Why Go?</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">A flirty province, Jílín (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">吉林</span></span>) teases with the ancient and the modern, the artificial and the supernatural. Travellers tired of great walls and imperial facades can explore Japanese-influenced architecture on the trail of the puppet emperor Puyi and the ruins of an ancient Korean kingdom. In fact, much of the far-eastern region comprises the little-known Korean Autonomous Prefecture, home to more than one million ethnic Koreans. Kimchi and cold noodles dominate the menu here and there’s an easy acceptance of outsiders.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Although known for its motor cities and smokestack towns, Jílín is also a popular ski destination and boasts China’s largest nature reserve. So go for the contrasts? No, go for the superlatives. Heaven Lake, a stunning, deep-blue volcanic crater lake within the country’s largest reserve, is one of China’s most mesmerising natural wonders. Yes, Jílín can be a little rough around the edges at times, but its rewards are pure polished jewels.</p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Korean kings once ruled parts of Jílín, and the discovery of important relics from the ancient Koguryo kingdom (37 BC–AD 668) in the small southeastern city of Jí’ān has resulted in the area being designated a World Heritage Site by Unesco.</p>
        <p class="body-text">The Japanese occupation of Manchuria in the early 1930s pushed Jílín to the world’s centre stage. Chángchūn became the capital of what the Japanese called Manchukuo, with Puyi (the last emperor of the Qing dynasty) given the role of figurehead of the puppet government. In 1944 the Russians wrested control of Jílín from the Japanese and, after stripping the area of its industrial base, handed the region back to Chinese control. For the next several years Jílín would pay a heavy price as one of the front lines in the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p>
        <p class="body-text">Jílín’s border with North Korea has dominated the region’s more recent history. As of 2012, there were an estimated 200,000 North Korean refugees in China. The Chinese government has not looked favourably on these migrants, refusing to grant them protected refugee status and has deported those discovered by the authorities.</p>
        <p class="body-text">A goal has been set to begin transforming Jílín into a biopharmaceutical powerhouse. The first milestone will be the industry contributing 7% to Jílín's total GDP by 2020.</p>
      
    </div>
    <div class="history">
      <h3>Climate</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Jílín is bitterly cold during its long winter, with heavy snow, freezing winds and temperatures as low as -20°C. In contrast, summer is pleasantly warm, especially along the coastal east, but short. Rainfall is moderate.</p>

        <p class="info-flush-left">The airport connects Chángbái Shān with Chángchūn and other major Chinese cities.</p>
        <p class="info-body-text">The rail and bus network connects all major cities and towns. High-speed D and G trains link Chángchūn with cities south to Shěnyáng, Dàlián and Dāndōng; north to Harbin and Qíqíhā'ěr; and east to Chángchūn, Jílín City and Yánjí.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">Chángbái Shān (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">长白山; </span></span>Ever-White Mountains), China’s largest nature reserve, covers 2100 sq km (densely forested) on the eastern edge of Jílín. By far the region’s top attraction, the park’s greenery and open space offers a welcome contrast to Jílín’s industrial cities.</p>
          <p class="body-text">The centrepiece of Chángbái Shān is the spellbinding Heaven Lake, whose white frozen surface melts into azure waters stretching across an outsized volcanic crater straddling the China–North Korea border come summer. Heaven Lake’s beauty and mystical reputation, including its Loch Ness–style monster <em>(guàiwu),</em> lures visitors from all over China, as well as many South Koreans. For the latter, the area is known as Mt Paekdu, or Paekdusan. North Korea claims that Kim Jung-il was born here (although he’s believed to have entered the world in Khabarovsk, Russia).</p>
        
        
          <p class="body-text">At lower elevations, the park’s forests are filled with white birch, Korean pines and hundreds of varieties of plants, including the much-prized Chángbái Shān ginseng. Above 2000m the landscape changes dramatically into a subalpine zone of short grasses and herbs. Giant patches of ice cover parts of the jagged peaks even in mid-June, and mountain streams rush down the treeless, rocky slopes. With the lake at an altitude of nearly 2200m, visitors should be prepared for lower temperatures. It might be sunny and hot when you enter the reserve, but at higher altitudes strong winds, rain and snow are possible.</p>
        
        
          <p class="body-text">Though you can visit most of the year, the best time to see the crater (and be assured the roads are open) is from June to early September.</p>

            <h3>THE LITTLE-KNOWN KOREAN AUTONOMOUS PREFECTURE</h3>
            
              <p class="box-flush-left">Ask people to list some of China’s ethnic minorities and you will hear talk of Tibetans, Uighur, Mongolians, Hui and perhaps the Li or Dai. Mention that China also has almost two million ethnic Koreans, and that the majority live in their own autonomous prefecture along the North Korean border, and you’ll likely get some astonished looks.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">The <strong>Yánbiān Korean Autonomous Prefecture</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">延边朝鲜族自治州</span></span>, Yánbiān Cháoxiǎnzú Zìzhìzhōu) is the only minority prefecture in the north of China. While established in 1955, in part as a reward for Koreans who fought on the side of the communists during the Civil War, the region has in fact been settled by Koreans since the 1880s. Today, street signs are officially bilingual, much of the population is bilingual (thanks to state-sponsored Korean-language schools), TV shows and newspapers are in Korean, and fusion food is ubiquitous.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">Over the past decades, however, the percentage of ethnic Koreans has dropped: from 60% in the 1950s to 38% today. In part this reflects the Chinese government’s desire to stamp out any potential for irredentism (many Koreans refer to Yánbiān as the ‘third Korea’, after the South and North) by encouraging Han migrants. More positively, it seems to indicate that the well-educated ethnic population experiences little to no discrimination in seeking employment or advancement outside the prefecture. Yánbiān may occupy a quarter of all Jílín province (it’s about half the size of South Korea), but the population is little more than two million, and opportunities are limited.</p>
              <p class="box-body-text">For those doing an extensive tour of northern China, consider looping up through Yánbiān as you go from Dāndōng or Chángbáishān to Harbin. The regional capital, Yánjí, is an attractive laid-back place, loaded with excellent Korean food, and the high-speed trains zoom through a bucolic landscape of corn fields, rolling forested hills and little brick villages to Harbin in four hours.</p>

From this fusion springs delicious food, as most northeasterners will tell you, especially budget eats. Yánjí's well-regarded university and a sprawling high school fuel a cool, young cafe vibe, while Yánjí's air quality is as equally fresh, with locals claiming it is cleaner than Hainan's.</p>

Jí’ān’s (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">集安</span></span>) extensive Koguryo pyramids, ruins and tombs resulted in Unesco designating it a World Heritage Site in 2004. Archaeologists have unearthed remains of three cities plus some 40 tombs around Jí’ān and the town of Huánrén (in Liáoníng province).</p>
          <p class="body-text">With a drive to capitalise on its Korean heritage’s tourism potential, modern-day Jí’ān has transformed itself into one of northern China’s more pleasant towns, with well-tended parks, leafy streets and a renovated riverfront area where you can gaze across to North Korea. Add in the town’s mountain backdrop, excellent Korean food, friendly locals and scenic train or bus rides getting here, and it’s a great little stopover on a loop through Dōngběi.</p>

          <p class="body-text">The Unesco World Heritage site, <strong>Koguryo Mountain Cities</strong>, is a collection of tombs and the archaeological remains from three main fortress cities. The site is spread around the very lovely green hills surrounding Jí’ān. Despite their historical significance, most of the city remains don’t have a terrible amount of detail to examine. Many of the tombs are cairns – essentially heaps of stones piled above burial sites – while others are stone pyramids. But there is something magical about the open fields and high terraces they were constructed on that makes you want to linger.</p>
          <p class="body-text">The most impressive fortress city, <a href="ebook-15-jilin-chi15.xhtml#ref-1a15bc34f9dac18ddeee677feef99d2d">Wándū Mountain City</a>, is enough to give an idea of what is on offer. It takes two hours to wander the expansive grounds.</p>

There’s little left of the original buildings, but the layout has been cleared and it’s immensely enjoyable scrambling about the terraces and taking in the views that surely must have been a deciding factor in establishing the capital here.</p>
            
            
              <p class="body-text">Down on the plains below the city, on a large shelf above the river, sits Jí’ān’s largest collection of giant stone cairns. Erected after the destruction of Wándū, this vast cemetery for the city’s noblemen is so far unaffected by mass tourism.

            <p class="flush-left">Since it hosted the 2007 Asian Winter Games, Běidàhú has established itself as one of China’s premier ski resorts. Located in a tiny village 53km south of Jílín City, the resort has runs on two mountains ranging from beginner to advanced. Though it hasn’t turned a profit since 2009, Běidàhú has seen continual growth with new runs and the opening of China's second Club Med resort. For more on skiing in Běidàhú, including tour, transport and accommodation information, see China Ski Tours (<a href="http://www.chinaskitours.com">www.chinaskitours.com</a>).</p>

          <p class="flush-left">The Japanese capital of Manchukuo between 1933 and 1945, Chángchūn (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">长春</span></span>) was also the centre of the Chinese film industry in the 1950s and '60s. Visitors expecting a Hollywood-like backdrop of palm trees and beautiful people will be disappointed, though. Chángchūn is now better known as China’s motor city, the largest automobile-manufacturing base in the country.</p>
          <p class="body-text">But for people on the trail of Puyi, China’s last emperor, it’s an essential stop. Its crossroad position, linking three provinces on the high-speed railway, makes Chángchūn a useful stopoff.</p>

His study, bedroom, temple, his wife’s quarters and opium den, as well as his concubine’s rooms, have all been elaborately re-created. His American car is also on display, but it’s the exhibition on his extraordinary life, told in part with a fantastic collection of photos, that is most enthralling. An English audio guide costs ¥20.
