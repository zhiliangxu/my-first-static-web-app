      <h2>January</h2>
      
        <p class="intro-text">North China is a deep freeze but the south is less bitter; preparations for the Lunar New Year get underway well in advance of the festival, which arrives any time between late January and March.</p>
      
      <div class="festivals">
        <h3><samp class="font-icon">z</samp>Spring Festival</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">The Lunar New Year is family-focused, with dining on dumplings and gift-giving of <em>hóngbāo</em> (red envelopes stuffed with money). Most families feast together on New Year’s Eve, then China goes on a big week-long holiday. Expect fireworks, parades, temple fairs and lots of colour.</p>

    <div>
      <h2>February</h2>
      
        <p class="intro-text">North China remains shockingly icy and dry but things are slowly warming up in Hong Kong and Macau. The Lunar New Year could well be underway, but sort out your tickets well in advance.</p>
      
      <div class="festivals">
        <h3><samp class="font-icon">z</samp>Monlam Great Prayer Festival</h3>

        <h3><samp class="font-icon">z</samp>Lantern Festival</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Held 15 days after the spring festival, this was traditionally a time when Chinese hung out highly decorated lanterns. Píngyáo in Shānxī is an atmospheric place to soak it up (sometimes held in March).</p>
        
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>March</h2>
      
        <p class="intro-text">China comes to life after a long winter, although it remains glacial at high altitudes. The mercury climbs in Hong Kong and abrasive dust storms billow into Běijīng, scouring everything in their path. It's still low season.</p>
      
      <div class="festivals">

          <p class="flush-left">Delve into south Chinese countryside to be bowled over by a landscape saturated in bright-yellow rapeseed. In some parts of China, such as lovely Wùyuán in Jiāngxī province, it’s a real tourist draw.</p>

    <div>
      <h2>April</h2>
      
        <p class="intro-text">Most of China is warm and it’s a good time to be on the road. The Chinese take several days off for the Qīngmíng festival, a traditional date for honouring their ancestors and now an official holiday.</p>
      
      <div class="festivals">
        <h3><samp class="font-icon">z</samp>A Good Soaking</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Flush away the dirt, demons and sorrows of the old year and bring in the fresh at the Dai New Year, with its water-splashing festival in Xīshuāngbǎnnà. Taking an umbrella is pointless.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">Petrolheads and aficionados of speed, burnt rubber and hairpin bends flock to Shànghǎi for some serious motor racing at the track near Āntíng. Get your hotel room booked early: it’s one of the most glamorous events on the Shànghǎi calendar.</p>
        
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>May</h2>
      
        <p class="intro-text">Mountain regions, such as Sìchuān’s Jiǔzhàigōu National Park, are in full bloom. For the first four days of May China is on holiday (Labour Day). Buddha's Birthday falls on the 8th day of the fourth lunar month, usually in May.</p>

      <h2>June</h2>

        <h3><samp class="font-icon">z</samp>Festival of Aurora Borealis</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">The Northern Lights are sometimes visible from Mòhé in Hēilóngjiāng, in the ultra-far north of China not far from the Russian border. Even if you don't get to see the (often elusive) multicoloured glow, the June midnight sun is a memorable experience.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div class="entertainment">

      <h2>July</h2>
      
        <p class="intro-text">Typhoons can wreak havoc with travel itineraries down south, lashing the Guǎngdōng and Fújiàn coastlines. Plenty of rain sweeps across China: the ‘plum rains’ give Shànghǎi a big soaking, and the grasslands of Inner Mongolia and Qīnghǎi turn green.</p>

        <p class="intro-text">The temperature gauge of Yangzi's ‘three ovens’ – Chóngqìng, Wǔhàn and Nánjīng – gets set to blow. Rainstorms hit Běijīng, which is usually 40°C plus; so is Shànghǎi. So head uphill to Lúshān, Mògānshān, Huáng Shān or Guōliàngcūn.</p>

      <h2>September</h2>
      
        <p class="intro-text">Come to Běijīng and stay put – September is part of the fleetingly lovely <em>tiāngāo qìshuǎng</em> (‘the sky is high and the air is fresh’) autumnal season – an event in itself. It's also a pleasant time to visit the rest of north China.</p>
