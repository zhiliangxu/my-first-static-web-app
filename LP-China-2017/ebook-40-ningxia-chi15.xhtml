          <p class="flush-left">With its raw landscape of dusty plains and stark mountains, sliced in two by the Yellow River (Huáng Hé), there's a distinct <em>Grapes of Wrath</em> feel to Níngxià (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">宁夏</span></span>). Outside the cities is a timeless landscape where farmers till the hard yellow earth just like their ancestors did.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Yet Níngxià was once the frontline between the empires of the Mongols and the Han Chinese and there's a host of historic sites here, ranging from little-seen Buddhist statues to the royal tombs of long-past dynasties, as well as ancient rock carvings that predate the emperors. And as the homeland of the Muslim Hui ethnic minority, Níngxià is culturally unique, too.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Then there’s the chance to camp out under the desert sky, or float down the Yellow River on a traditional raft. But best of all, Níngxià sees few foreign visitors so it seems like you have the place all to yourself.</p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Níngxià had been on the periphery of Chinese empires ever since the Qin dynasty, but it took centre stage in the 10th century AD when the Tangut people declared the establishment of the Xixia (Western Xia) empire in the face of Song opposition. The empire was composed of modern-day Gānsù, Níngxià, Shaanxi and western Inner Mongolia, but it soon collapsed in the face of Mongol might.</p>
        <p class="body-text">The Mongol retreat in the 14th century left a void that was filled by both Muslim traders from the west and Chinese farmers from the east. Tensions between the two resulted in Níngxià being caught up in the great Muslim Rebellion that convulsed northwest China in the mid-19th century.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Once part of Gānsù, Níngxià is China’s smallest province, although technically it is an autonomous region for the Muslim Hui ethnic minority, who make up one-third of the population, rather than an official province. It remains one of the poorest areas of China, with a sharp economic divide between the more fertile, Han Chinese–dominated north and the parched, sparsely populated south.</p>
      
    </div>
    <div class="history">
      <h3>Climate</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Part of the Loess Plateau, Níngxià is composed primarily of arid mountain ranges and highlands in a region of very low rainfall. Summer temperatures soar during the day, while winters are long and often freezing; spring is lovely, though blustery.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">In the sun-parched land of Níngxià, Yínchuān (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">银川</span></span>) has managed to thrive. The Tangut founders wisely chose this spot as their capital, planting the city between a source of water (the Yellow River) and a natural barrier from the Gobi Desert (the Hèlán Shān mountains).</p>
          <p class="body-text">Modern-day Yínchuān is predominantly Han, although its many mosques reveal its status as the capital of the Hui peoples’ homeland. But the most interesting sights, the Western Xia Tombs and Hèlán Shān to the west of the city, predate both the Han and the Hui. Yínchuān is also a handy jumping-off point for longer trips to western Inner Mongolia.</p>
          <p class="body-text">The name Yínchuān means 'Silver River'. Some say it comes from the alkaline land which can appear white, while others say that it's because the Yellow River is clear in these parts and can appear bright, but the exact origin is obscure.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div class="history">
        <h3>History</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">The Western Xia, or Tanguts, were descendants of tribes forced to flee the northeastern Tibetan plateau towards the end of the 10th century. Although short-lived, at the kingdom's height it encompassed an area composed of modern-day Gānsù, Níngxià, Shaanxi and Western Inner Mongolia, and even rivalled the Song and Liao dynasties.</p>
          <p class="body-text">The Western Xia present such an enigma today because nearly all traces of their civilisation vanished in one fell swoop – thanks to the Mongols, who virtually obliterated them in 1227. Yínchuān was besieged for a year; towards the end of the siege, Genghis Khan died, possibly while fighting against the Western Xia. The city was then taken and most of its inhabitants put to the sword. However, if one were to believe Marco Polo, and also archaeological evidence uncovered in Kharakhoto (near Ejin Qi, Inner Mongolia), it's possible that some form of Western Xia culture survived for at least another hundred years.</p>

The pagoda was slightly damaged during the 2008 Sìchuān earthquake, so sadly can no longer be climbed, but repair work may reopen it down the line. For now, it is a highly photogenic element of the surrounding temple, while to the south lie the waters and willow trees of South Lake.</p>

Also known as North Pagoda (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">北塔; </span></span>Běitǎ) and at one time also called the Black Pagoda, the structure was possibly originally built in the 5th century (although the exact date is unknown), before being toppled by an earthquake in 1739. It was then rebuilt in its current form in 1771. Take bus 29 from the Drum Tower, then enter by the east gate which will take you to the pagoda (and the lovely lakeside park it is located in).</p>

              <p class="flush-left">The Western Xia Tombs, which resemble giant beehives, are Níngxià’s most celebrated sight. The first tombs were built a millennium ago by Li Yuanhao, the founder of the Western Xia dynasty. There are nine imperial tombs, plus 200 lesser tombs, in an area of 50 sq km – there are electric carts if you’re not up for walking. The tomb you’ll see belongs to Li Yuanhao; it's a 23m-tall tomb originally constructed as an octagonal seven-storey wooden pagoda. All that remains is the large earthen core. Permits, usually organised through local tour operators, are required to visit other tombs in the area.</p>
            
            
              <p class="body-text">The examples of Buddhist art in the good site museum (8am to 5.30pm) offer a rare glimpse into the ephemeral Western Xia culture, and point to clear artistic influences from neighbouring Tibet and Central Asia. There are also many fascinating artefacts excavated from Li Yuanhao’s tomb.</p>
              <p class="body-text">The tombs are 33km west of Yínchuān. A return taxi costs from around ¥150 (including waiting time). Regular buses (¥12, every 30 minutes, 7am to 7pm) run past the tombs from the bus station next to the Nánguān Mosque (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">南关清真寺; </span></span>Nánguān Qīngzhènsí), not far from South Gate Square (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">南门广场; </span></span>Nánmén Guǎngchǎng); you will need to tell the driver you want to get off at the tombs. From the South Gate, you could also take bus 2 or 4 to its terminus in Xīxià Qū and then take a van (around ¥40 each way) from there. As the site is on the road towards Bayanhot, you can get off any bus heading that way.</p>

              <p class="flush-left">The archaeological site of Shuǐ Dòng Gōu, 25km east of Yínchuān, right on the border with Inner Mongolia, has been turned into something of an adventure theme park. The site is divided into two parts; the first is a <strong>museum</strong> that resembles Jabba the Hutt’s bunker and which contains the Palaeolithic-era relics first uncovered here in 1923.</p>
            
            
              <p class="body-text">From there, it’s a golf-cart ride to an unrestored section of the <strong>Great Wall</strong> dating back to the Ming dynasty. Then it’s a walk, boat trip, donkey- and camel-cart ride to a <strong>fortress</strong> with an elaborate network of underground tunnels once used by Chinese soldiers defending the Wall. The renovated tunnels include trap doors, false passages and booby traps.</p>
              <p class="body-text">The catch is that the admission price to Shuǐ Dòng Gōu only lets you into the site itself. Everything else – the museum, fort and all transport – costs extra, making this an expensive day out. Unless you fancy an 8km walk around the complex, the cheapest way to do it is to buy the through ticket (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">通票</span></span>, <em>tōngpiào</em>) for ¥130. Standard admission costs ¥60.</p>
              <p class="body-text">Buses run from Yínchuān’s southern bus terminal past Shuǐ Dòng Gōu (¥12, 40 minutes, eight daily) from 7.30am to 5.30pm. To return, wait by the highway and flag down any passing Yínchuān-bound bus.</p>

              <p class="flush-left">Gāo Temple means 'High Temple', and this is one of the most extraordinary temples in China, where the three faiths of Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism are revered, although Buddhist deities are clearly in the ascendancy. Do check out the unnerving <strong>Arhat Hall</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">罗汉堂; </span></span>Luóhàn Táng), which contains 500 arhat, many in grotesque and unsettling guises and postures, including one whose arm shoots through the ceiling. The drawcard oddity is the <strong>Dì Gōng</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">地宫</span></span>), a former bomb shelter and labyrinth converted into a Buddhist hell.</p>
            
            
              <p class="body-text">The eerie, dimly lit tunnels contain numerous scenes of the damned having their tongues cut out, being sawed in half, eyes poked out or stoked in the fires of hell, while their screams echo all around. The ceiling is very low, so prepare to crouch your way through. Look for the signs to 'The Infernal'.</p>
              <p class="body-text">The name of the temple becomes clear after you exit the <strong>Hall of Heavenly Kings</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">天王殿; </span></span>Tiānwáng Diàn) to climb some seriously steep steps to the halls high above. After your climb, you are greeted by woodwork in a blaze of gold, blue, green and vermilion paint. At the time of research, the temple halls on the upper floors at the top of the steps were closed. To the rear, a reclining Buddha lies supine in most relaxed fashion within the <strong>Sleeping Buddha Hall</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">卧佛殿; </span></span>Wòfó Diàn), while other side halls are dedicated to Guanyin and other Bodhisattvas as a host of obscure Taoist deities peek out from smoky shrine niches in the walls.</p>

              <p class="flush-left">The desert playground of Shāpōtóu, 17km west of Zhōngwèi, lies on the fringes of the Tengger Desert at the dramatic convergence of sand dunes, the Yellow River and lush farmlands. It’s based around the Shāpōtóu Desert Research Centre, which was founded in 1956 to battle the ever-worsening problem of desertification in China’s northwest.</p>
            
            
              <p class="body-text">These days, though, Shāpōtóu is more of an amusement park. The main office is more of a massive service centre, with a post office and a large number of shops. You can zipline (¥80) on a wire across the Yellow River, go sand-sledding (¥30), camel riding (¥60 to ¥100) or bungee jumping (¥160).</p>
              <p class="body-text">It’s also a good place to raft the churning Yellow River. The traditional mode of transport on the river for centuries was the <em>yángpí fázi</em> (leather raft), made from sheep or cattle skins soaked in oil and brine and then inflated. From Shāpōtóu you can roar upstream on a speedboat and return on a traditional raft. Prices range from ¥80 to ¥240, depending on how far you go. You can also combine the boat/raft ride with a camel ride (¥110). If you want to flee the crowds for the sands, off-road buggies (¥300 to ¥1500) are available for rent, taking up to three passengers. Tourist buses wheel visitors around (¥10 to ¥15) from point to point.</p>
              <p class="body-text">Shāpō Shānzhuāng is a basic but comfortable hotel near the dunes. Meals are available.</p>
              <p class="body-text">Bus 2 (¥5, 45 minutes) from the bus station (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">客运总站; </span></span><em>kèyùn zǒngzhàn</em>) runs between Zhōngwèi and Shāpōtóu from 7.30am to 6.30pm. You can also pick it up on Changcheng Xijie about 200m past the Gāo Temple on the opposite side of the road. Taxis cost ¥30 each way.</p>

The sun is fierce out here, so you’ll need a hat, sunglasses and plenty of water. Nights are cool, so bring a warm layer.</p>

The price includes transport, food and guide. Ask your guide to bring along a sand sled for a sunset surfing session. Drinking beers around the campfire under a starry sky tops off the experience. The desert trek can be combined with a rafting trip down the Yellow River.</p>

            <p class="box-flush-left">The Hui (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">回族</span></span>) are perhaps China’s most unusual ethnic minority; they are the only people to be designated as one solely because of their religious beliefs. The Hui don’t have their own language, speaking only Mandarin, and are scattered throughout every province of the country with nearly 80% of the 10-million-odd Hui living outside their official homeland.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">Their origins date back more than 1000 years to the time of the Silk Road, when trade thrived between China and the Middle East and Central Asia. Arab traders intermarried with the local women and now most Hui are ethnically indistinguishable from the Han Chinese. What marks them out is their adherence to Islam.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">Most Hui men wear white skullcaps, while many women don headscarves. The more educated can read and speak Arabic, a result of studying the Koran in its original language. For many young Hui, learning Arabic is the path to a coveted job as a translator for the Chinese companies on the east coast doing business in the Middle East.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">Although the Hui can be found all over China, they are most numerous in the northwest provinces of Gānsù, Níngxià and Shaanxi. True to their origins as traders and caravanserai operators, many Hui are still engaged in small businesses, especially the running of restaurants.</p>

Cut into the five adjacent sandstone hills are 132 caves housing a collection of over 300 Buddhist statues dating back 1400 years, from the Northern Wei to the Sui and Tang dynasties. Cave 5 contains the largest statue, a colossal Maitreya (future Buddha), standing 20.6m high.</p>
