        <p class="introduction-flush-left">China has a broad range of eating options from street food to fine dining; if you don't speak Chinese, you'll find photo menus are common. In most areas it's possible to hunt down mouth-watering specialities from other regions.</p>

        <h3>Cheap Treats</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Snacking your way around China is a fine way to sample the different flavours of the land while on the move. Most towns have a street market or a night market (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">夜市; </span></span><em>yèshì</em>), a great place for good-value snacks and meals; you can either take it away or park yourself on a wobbly stool and grab a beer.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Street markets such as Kāifēng’s boisterous night market abound with choices you may not find in restaurants. Vocal vendors will be forcing their tasty creations on you but you can also see what other people are buying and what’s being cooked up; all you have to do is join the queue and point.</p>

      <h2>Local Specialities</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Běijīng &amp; the North</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Besides being the most obvious place to seek out authentic Peking duck (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">北京烤鸭; </span></span><em>Běijīng kǎoyā</em>), Běijīng is where you'll find the best Peking-duck restaurants.</p>
        
        
          <p class="flush-left">For the most scrumptious <em>jiǎozi</em> (dumplings), head north and northeast. If you like them crispy, get them <em>guōtiē</em> (fried). Shànghǎi’s delicious interpretation is <em>xiǎolóngbāo</em> – steamed and scalding.</p>
        
        
          <p class="flush-left">In the north, also fill up on a tasty dish of <em>húntún</em> (wontons) stuffed with juicy leeks and minced pork, or <em>Ménggǔ huǒguō</em> (Mongolian hotpot<em>)</em>, a hearty brew of mutton, onions and cabbage.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Shànghǎi</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">In case you’re pining for something sweet, head to Shànghǎi for delicious <em>mìzhī xūnyú</em> (honey-smoked carp), and where you can also dine on more savoury helpings of steaming <em>xiǎolóngbāo</em> dumplings – which require considerable dexterity to consume without meat juices jetting to all compass points.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Look out for the characters <span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">本帮菜 </span></span><em>(běnbāngcài)</em> on restaurant shopfronts and in menus, which refers to authentic Shànghǎi homestyle cooking.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Shaanxi</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Stop by Xī'ān for warming servings of <em>yángròu pàomó</em> (mutton broth and shredded flat bread).</p>
          <p class="body-text">Look for <em>ròujiāmó</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">肉夹馍; </span></span>fried pork or beef in pitta bread, sometimes with green peppers and cumin), <em>ròuchuàn</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">肉串; </span></span>kebabs) and yummy <em>yángròu</em> <em>pàomó</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">羊肉泡馍; </span></span>lamb broth poured over breadcrumbs).</p>
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Húnán</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Húnán is no province for lightweight, dainty palates. A firecracker of a cuisine, Xiāngcài (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">湘菜; </span></span>Húnán food) is one of the most potent of Chinese cooking styles, with ample use of chilli and piquant herbs. It eschews the numbing heat of Sìchuān cooking and instead goes for a sharp, full-flavoured spiciness.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Hong Kong, Macau &amp; Guǎngzhōu</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Dim sum is steamed up across China, but like the Cantonese dialect, it’s best left to the masters of the south to get it right. Hong Kong, Macau and Guǎngzhōu should be your first stops – they set the dim sum benchmark.</p>
        
        
          <p class="flush-left">While in Macau, taste the Macanese dish <em>porco à alentejana,</em> a mouthwatering casserole of pork and clams.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Hǎinán</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Hǎinán specialties include <em>dōngshān yáng</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">东山羊; </span></span>mountain goat, stewed, roasted or cooked in coconut milk), <em>chǎobīng</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">炒冰; </span></span>blended tropical fruit that is 'fried’ on a cold plate until it turns thick like sorbet) and <em>jiājī yā</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">加积鸭; </span></span>steamed duck).</p>
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Yúnnán</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Yúnnán specialities include <em>qìguōjī</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">汽锅鸡; </span></span>slow-cooked, herb-infused chicken), <em>xuānweī huǒtuǐ</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">宣威火腿; </span></span>Yúnnán ham), <em>guòqiáo mǐxiàn</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">过桥米线; </span></span>across-the-bridge noodles) and <em>rǔbǐng</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">辱饼; </span></span>goat’s cheese).</p>
        
        
          <p class="flush-left">Téngchōng is famous for its cured ham, known as <em>huǒtuǐ</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">火腿</span></span>), as well as having all the great Yúnnán vegies and mushrooms, and there are many restaurants in the region to sample them at.</p>
          <p class="body-text">In Lìjiāng, make sure to try the cuisine of the local Naxi minority, while Shangri-la is a great place to sample Tibetan cooking.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Sìchuān</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Some like it hot, and little comes hotter than the fiery flavours of Sìchuān. Begin with mouth-numbing <em>mápó dòufu</em> (spicy beancurd dish), followed by the celebrated <em>gōngbǎo jīdīng</em> (spicy chicken with peanuts). If the smoke isn’t now coming out of your ears, <em>shuǐzhǔ yú</em> (fish smothered in chilli) should have you breathing fire.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Chóngqìng</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Chóngqìng hotpot is ideal for banishing the bitter cold of a northern winter, while in its home town – one of China's 'three furnaces' on the Yangzi River – old folk devour the spiciest of hotpots in summer with little regard for the sweltering weather.</p>
        
        <div class="context-eps"><img alt="shutterstock285888404jpg" src="images/shutterstock_285888404.jpg"/></div><div class="caption"><span>Chóngqìng hotpot | </span><span>YANG YIDONG/SHUTTERSTOCK ©</span></div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Xīnjiāng</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">To sample the full range of Uighur food, make your way to Kashgar, where you'll have your pick of street food and night markets.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Fruit is a big deal in Xīnjiāng, from Hāmì's <em>tawuz</em> (watermelon) to Turpan's <em>uzum</em> (grapes) and <em>yimish</em> (raisins). Market heave with fruit from July to September.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Gānsù</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">The province's most famous export is Lánzhōu beef noodles (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">牛肉拉面; </span></span><em>niúròu lāmiàn</em>) – hand-pulled noodles in spicy soup – which are available in small restaurants and shops all over Gānsù.</p>

      <h2>How to Eat &amp; Drink</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>When to Eat</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">The Chinese eat early. Lunch usually commences from around 11.30am, either self-cooked or a takeaway at home, or in a streetside restaurant. Dinner kicks off from around 6pm. Reflecting these dining times, some restaurants open at around 11am, close for an afternoon break at about 2.30pm, open again around 5pm and then close in the late evening. Street-food vendors then take over the duty of feeding the late-night hungry folk.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Where to Eat</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Chinese eateries come in every conceivable shape, size and type: from shabby, hole-in-the-wall noodle outfits with flimsy PVC furniture, blaring TV sets and well-worn plastic menus to gilded, banquet-style restaurants where elegant cheongsam-clad waitresses show you to your seat, straighten your chopsticks and bring you a warm hand towel and a gold-embossed wine list. In between are legions of very serviceable midrange restaurants serving cuisine from across China.</p>
          <p class="body-text">As dining in China is such a big, sociable and often ostentatious affair, many Chinese banqueting-style restaurants have huge round tables, thousand-candle-power electric lights and precious little sense of intimacy or romance. Overattentive and ever-present staff can add to the discomfort for foreigners.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Eating with Kids</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">Similar to travelling with children in China, dining out with kids can be a challenge. Budget eateries won’t have kids’ menus; nor will they have booster seats. Smarter restaurants may supply these but it can be touch-and-go. In large cities you will be able to find more restaurants switched on to the needs of families; Western restaurants especially may have a play area, kids’ menu, activities, booster seats and other paraphernalia.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Menus</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">In Běijīng, Shànghǎi and other large cities, you may be proudly presented with an English menu (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">英文菜谱; </span></span><em>Yīngwén càipǔ</em>). In smaller towns and out in the sticks, don’t expect anything other than a Chinese-language menu and a hovering waitress with no English-language skills. The best is undoubtedly the ever-handy photo menu. If you like the look of what other diners are eating, just point at it and say 'wǒ yào nèi gè' (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">我要那个; </span></span>'I want that') – a very handy phrase. Alternatively, pop into the kitchen and point out the meats and vegetables you would like to eat.</p>
        
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Vegetarian Travellers</h2>
      
        <p class="flush-left">If you’d rather chew on a legume than a leg of lamb, it can be hard to find truly vegetarian dishes. China’s history of famine and poverty means the consumption of meat has always been a sign of status, and is symbolic of health and wealth. Eating meat is also considered to enhance male virility, so vegetarian men raise eyebrows. Partly because of this, there is virtually no vegetarian movement in China, although Chinese people may forgo meat for Buddhist reasons. For the same reasons, they may avoid meat on certain days of the month but remain carnivorous at other times.</p>
        <p class="body-text">You will find that vegetables are often fried in animal-based oils; vegetable soups are often made with chicken or beef stock, so simply choosing 'vegetable' items on the menu is ineffective. A dish that you are told does not contain meat may still mean it is riddled with tiny pieces of meat. In Běijīng and Shànghǎi you will, however, find a generous crop of vegetarian restaurants to choose from, alongside outfits such as Element Fresh, which has a decent range of healthy vegetarian options.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Out of the large cities, your best bet may be to head to a sizeable active Buddhist temple or monastery, where Buddhist vegetarian restaurants are often open to the public. Buddhist vegetarian food typically consists of ‘mock meat’ dishes created from tofu, wheat gluten, potato and other vegetables. Some of the dishes are almost works of art, with vegetarian ingredients sculpted to look like spare ribs or fried chicken. Sometimes the chefs go to great lengths to create ‘bones’ from carrots and lotus roots.</p>
        <p class="body-text">If you want to say ‘I am a vegetarian’ in Chinese, the phrase to use is <em>'wǒ chī sù</em>' (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">我吃素</span></span>).</p>
