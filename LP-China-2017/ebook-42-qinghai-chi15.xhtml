          <p class="flush-left">Big, bold and beautifully barren, Qīnghǎi (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">青海</span></span>), larger than any country in the EU, occupies a vast swath of the northeastern chunk of the Tibetan Plateau. As far as Tibetans are concerned, this is Amdo, one of old Tibet’s three traditional provinces. Much of what you’ll experience here will feel more Tibetan than Chinese; there are monasteries galore, yaks by the thousands and nomads camped out across high-altitude grasslands.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Rough-and-ready Qīnghǎi, which means 'Blue Sea' in Chinese, is classic off-the-beaten-track territory, often with a last frontier feel to it. Travelling here can be a little inconvenient, though China’s rapid development plans have begun to touch the province, with huge highways and new rail lines under construction. Despite that, Qīnghǎi still delivers a heavy dose of solitude among middle-of-nowhere high-plateau vistas, Martian-like red mountains, mouth-watering cuisine and encounters with remote communities of China’s ethnic minorities.</p>

    <div class="history">
      <h3>History</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">The northern Silk Road passed through what is now Qīnghǎi province, and in 121 BC the Han dynasty established a military base near modern Xīníng to counter Tibetan raids on trading caravans.</p>
        <p class="body-text">During the Yarlung dynasty, a time of great expansion of Tibetan power and influence, Qīnghǎi was brought directly under Lhasa’s control. After the collapse of the dynasty in AD 842, local rulers filled the ensuing power vacuum, some nominally acting as vassals of Song dynasty emperors.</p>
        <p class="body-text">In the 13th century, all of Qīnghǎi was incorporated into the Yuan empire under Genghis Khan. During this time, the Tǔ began to move into the area around Hùzhù, followed a century or so later by the Salar Muslims into Xúnhuà.</p>
        <p class="body-text">After the fall of the Yuan dynasty, local Mongol rulers and the Dalai Lamas in Lhasa wrestled for power. The Qing emperors restored the region to full Chinese control, setting it up as a prefecture with more or less the same boundaries as today. As in the past, however, they left administrative control in the hands of local elites.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Qīnghǎi became a province of China in 1928 during the republican era, though at the time it was under the de facto control of the Muslim Ma clan. When the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, Qīnghǎi retained its provincial borders and capital city, Xīníng.</p>
        <p class="body-text">In the late 1950s an area near Qīnghǎi Lake (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">青海湖; </span></span>Qīnghǎi Hú) became the centre of China’s nuclear weapons research program. During the next 40 years, at least 30 tests were held at a secret base, the Qīnghǎi Mine.</p>
        <p class="body-text">In April 2010, Yùshù, a Tibetan town in remote southwest Qīnghǎi, was devastated by a 7.1-magnitude earthquake. Thousands died – some say tens of thousands – but the rebuilding effort was swift and Yùshù's main centre reopened as a tourist destination in early 2014.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Today, the province is experiencing rapid growth (not unlike the rest of China). It's not uncommon to see large apartment blocks under construction in the capital Xīníng and even in provincial towns. Highways are being constructed to connect places like Mt Amnye Machen to the rest of the province.</p>

        <p class="info-flush-left">As with everything in China, things change rapidly in Qīnghǎi and areas that may be open to travellers one week could be closed or require permits the next. It’s always best to check once you arrive before heading to a new destination. The Xīníng <a href="ebook-42-qinghai-chi15.xhtml#ref-d952b4c271093547310e8e1a95651ffd">Public Security Bureau</a> has updated lists.</p>

        <p class="info-flush-left">Off-the-beaten-track overland routes include south into Sìchuān, at Aba or Shíqú, and north into Gānsù or Xīnjiāng from Golmud (check before going as foreigners travelling this way may need a special permit). Routes southwest into Tibet are even more remote and are usually closed to foreigners altogether, and some areas north of Qīnghǎi Lake have been closed to foreigners for years.</p>
      
      
        <p class="info-flush-left">Most people arrive by train, usually into Xīníng, but after that train lines are limited, so long-distance buses are the best way to get around. In more remote areas you’ll often have no option but to hire a private car and driver.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">Situated on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, this lively provincial capital makes a good base from which to dive into the surrounding sights and on to the more remote regions of Qīnghǎi and beyond. Though many travellers use Xīníng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">西宁</span></span>) as a jumping-off or landing point from the Qīnghǎi–Tibet Railway, it’s also a wonderful place to explore the province’s varied cultures – Muslim (Huí, Salar and Uighur), Tibetan and Han Chinese – especially the dynamite culinary mix that these groups bring together.</p>

The highlight is a 618m-long <em>thangka</em> (Tibetan sacred art) scroll – the world’s longest – which charts most of Tibetan history. Completed in 1997, it’s not an ancient relic, but it is unbelievably long. It took 400 artists four years to complete and is displayed in a maze-like exhibition hall.</p>

It's not the prettiest, but in fact, it’s one of the largest mosques in China. Friday lunchtime prayers regularly attract 50,000 worshippers, who spill out onto the streets before and afterwards. And during Ramadan as many as 300,000 come here to pray, with police closing off the streets to traffic.</p>

The monastery lies at the edge of a forested valley, and many chapels perch wondrously on the sides of a cliff face. Give yourself a couple of hours to explore the entire picturesque area.</p>
              
              
                <p class="box-flush-left">Famous for its academies of medicine and astrology, its scholars and its living Buddhas <em>(tulku)</em>, Yòuníng Monastery (<em>Rgolung</em> in Tibetan) was instrumental in solidifying Gelugpa dominance over the Amdo region. The monastery was founded by the Mongolian 4th Dalai Lama, and over time became a religious centre for the local Tǔ (themselves a distant Mongolian people). At its height, over 7000 monks resided here; these days there are probably fewer than 200, all of whom are Tǔ. Expansion works continue in the main complex. Three kilometres up the road from the main complex is a small <em>kora</em> that takes you up a smaller temple and up the surrounding hills.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">A daily bus (¥12, 90 minutes, 10.30am) departs from <a href="ebook-42-qinghai-chi15.xhtml#ref-b4cbfcb277c0f46fa52b262d46767d19">Bayi Road Bus Station</a>.

From there, you'll need to hire a taxi (one way/return ¥70/100, 30 minutes), Alternately, if you have a group, you could hire a private car or taxi (return ¥400) from Xīníng. The monastery is about 25km north of Píng'ān.</p>

Bookings by email only.</p>
            
            
              <p class="body-text">The best way to get here is via taxi (¥15) or take bus 31 from the railway station and get off at the Tibetan Medicine Hospital (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">藏医院</span></span>) stop, walk back 25m to Jïanxìn Xīang (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">建新巷</span></span>) and up the road 150m till you see a gated complex on the right. Look for the first blue building on the left and find doorway 3. You can get also bus tickets from a China Post office just to the left of the compound as you exit. As a former guide, Tashi also helps with Tibetan visas and local travel plans.</p>

            <p class="box-list-a"><strong>Miànpiàn</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">面片</span></span>) Literally translated as ‘noodle slices,’ this dish consists of small, flat squares of noodles cooked in a light broth with greens, fresh tomato and sometimes egg and bits of meat. This is a favourite local snack and you’ll see small restaurants all over the province with blinking signs boasting the Chinese characters for <em>miànpiàn</em>.</p>
            <p class="box-list-a"><strong>Kǎobǐng</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">烤饼</span></span>) These thick bread buns are baked and then further roasted over coal fire and lightly dusted with spicy chilli powder, garlic salt and spices. Order in Muslim restaurants or procure from street vendors, who roast them over coal after dark.</p>
            <p class="box-list-a"><strong>Mómo</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">馍馍</span></span>) Tibetan-style dumplings similar to Chinese <em>bāozi</em> (steamed meat buns), typically filled with savoury lamb mince and served with spiced chilli oil. An alternate version is served in hot broth.</p>
            <p class="box-list-a"><strong>Yak milk yoghurt</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">牦牛酸奶</span></span>, <em>máoniú suānnǎi</em>) Whether love or hate, visitors usually have a strong reaction to this Tibetan-style yoghurt made from yak’s milk. Shops and vendors all over Qīnghǎi sell small portions in plastic cups or bowls, usually served with a sprinkling of rock sugar to balance the tartness. It’s a wonderfully fresh dessert or snack. Locals also claim it helps combat altitude sickness.</p>

            <p class="body-text">Bike rental ranges from ¥80 to ¥180, depending on the model. All are solid brand-name bikes and rental includes panniers, helmet, tool kit and spares. The sun gets really harsh so be sure to bring sunscreen, long-sleeved riding gear, sunglasses and a face bandana.</p>

It’s of enormous historical significance, and hundreds of monks still live here but, perhaps because it’s such a big tourist draw, the atmosphere can feel a bit overrun. The artwork and architecture, however, remain impressive.</p>

You’ll see pilgrims walking circuits of the building and prostrating outside the entrance. Also worth seeking out is the <strong>Yak Butter Scripture Temple</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">酥油画馆; </span></span>Sūyóuhuà Guǎn), which houses sculptures of human figures, animals and landscapes carved out of yak butter.</p>

                <p class="box-flush-left">Alas, the park no longer allows private cars unless you're a) coming from Guìdé or b) in a local car. This means you're either shunted on a pricey but decent fixed bus-and-boat tour (roughly three hours) or you can skip the entrance fee and fully experience the park, including plenty of photo stops, by going with a local taxi driver (¥100 if you find at least one other person to share with).</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">Otherwise, find a private driver to bring you here from Guìdé (¥400 per day). To get here from Xīníng, take the 10.30am bus to Kanbula from the main bus station. You'll be dropped 7km from the park entrance. Taxis will take you there for ¥10. The last bus returns at 4.30pm or so so make sure you get out early otherwise you'll have to stay the night where the bus drops you or hitch back.</p>

The monks will show you around and you can usually ask to see a showroom or workshop. The resident artists are no amateurs – commissions for their <em>thangka</em> (scroll paintings) come in all the way from Lhasa.</p>

There are a handful of showrooms outside the Lower Monastery where you can browse and buy.</p>
              <p class="body-text">The Lower Monastery is easily recognisable by eight large <em>chörten</em> (Tibetan stupa) out front and a new triple Buddha statue. While there, check out the 100-year-old <strong>Jampa Lhakhang</strong> (Jampa Temple) and the newer chapels dedicated to Chenresig and Tsongkhapa.</p>
              <p class="body-text">The Upper Monastery includes a massive modern <em>chörten</em> as well as the old <em>dukhang</em> (assembly hall) and the new chapel dedicated to Maitreya (Shampa in Amdo dialect). The interior murals painted by local artists are superb.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">As the Yellow River (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">黄河; </span></span>Huáng Hé) flows down from the Tibetan Plateau it makes a series of sharp bends, powering its way past ancient Guìdé (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">贵德</span></span>), where the water turns turquoise. The river, popular with Chinese tourists, was to provide a tourism lifeline to the town and the government's plans began with the old town (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">古城; </span></span><em>gǔchéng</em>), still largely enclosed within its crumbling 10m-high mud walls. Buildings were knocked down, and faux new-old ones were built – but the promised tourism boom never quite got there.</p>
          <p class="body-text">Guìdé, stuck in limbo between boom town and old town, is the perfect epitome of modern China. Walk past the slick facade in the old town and you'll find crumbling ruins and residents clinging on to life in packed earthen houses. It's the space between the old and new which makes Guìdé so intriguing. Wandering along the remains of the Qing dynasty walls through the back lanes behind the old town towards the Yellow River offers a glimpse at China that will no longer be here in the next couple of years. So get here while you can.</p>

Set against the contrasting blue Qīnghǎi skies and teal waters of the Yellow River, this is a lovely spot to spend an afternoon wandering and taking photos, or exploring the peculiar geology of this part of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
            
            
              <p class="body-text">There's a museum with decent signs and maps in English, and well-kept paths allow for easy access to the geological formations, making this an easy walk rather than a back-country hike. Admission includes a Chinese-speaking guide (which you can politely decline) and you can also save ¥20 by declining the tourist electric car (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">观光车; </span></span>Guānguāng Chē). Once inside, there are opportunities to go off-piste and clamber up the dirt mounds between canyons but do take care as you're on your own. The park also has the Tōngtīanxía (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">通天峡</span></span>) trail that's under renovation at the time of research but once open will take you to the top of one of the peaks for views of the Yellow River.</p>
              <p class="body-text">The park is located about 20km north of Guìdé. A taxi will cost around ¥40 or you can wait at the exit gate of the bus station and get on a bus heading towards Xīníng and tell the driver you're stopping here. Coming from Xīníng, the bus to Guìdé can also drop you off. Local bus 11 stops here.</p>

A shiny new town centre built in Tibetan-style architecture (with a modern Chinese twist) was officially reopened in 2014.

Simple ones cost between ¥1 and ¥10 while massive slabs with prayer chants cost well over ¥10,000. The earthquake unearthed <em>mani</em> stones used by the Chinese for building works: these were repatriated to the pile!

            <p class="body-text">The temple, which suffered minor damage from the 2010 Yùshù earthquake, is small, and few linger in it for long.

            <p class="body-text">A steep trail (a popular <em>kora</em> route for pilgrims) ascends from the end of the row of eight <em>chörtens</em> (Tibetan stupas)to the left of the temple. At the end of the trail head up the grassy side valley for some great hiking and stunning open views.</p>

                <p class="box-flush-left">The 6282m peak of Machen Kangri, or Mt Amnye Machen, is Amdo’s most sacred mountain – it’s eastern Tibet’s equivalent to Mt Kailash in western Tibet. Tibetan pilgrims travel for weeks to circumambulate the peak, believing it to be home to the protector deity Machen Pomra. The circuit’s sacred geography and wild mountain scenery make it a fantastic, adventurous trekking destination.</p>
              
              
                <p class="box-flush-left">Unfortunately, much of the route is suffering the effects of a major road project that will see elevated bridges and asphalt highways passing through the Amnye Machen region. This means that you may spend much of the route covered in dust billowing in the wake of heavy vehicles. The construction is slated to be completed in 2017/18 (depending on which section you're in). It's best to check before you go.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">The full circuit takes around 11 days (including transport to/from Xīníng), though tourists often limit themselves to a half circuit. Several monasteries lie alongside the route. With almost all of the route above 4000m, and the highest pass hitting 4600m, it’s essential to acclimatise before setting off, preferably by spending a night or two at the nearby Mǎduō (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">玛多; </span></span>4290m). The best months to trek are May to October, though be prepared for snow early and late in the season.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">Since local public transport is almost nonexistent, most trekkers go on an organised tour. Expect to pay around US$180 per person per day, all-inclusive in a group, and double or triple that if you are going solo. During the construction period, the tour agencies listed in the Xīnīng section take trekkers on an alternate (non-pilgrimage) route through the less disturbed parts of Mt Amnye Machen.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">If you do want to try venturing out on your own, take the bus to Huāshíxiá (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">花石峡</span></span>) or Mǎduō and then hitch or hire a shared minivan (¥300 to ¥400 per person) to Xiàdàwǔ (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">下大吾</span></span>). Mǎduō is slightly further away but it has better amenities and you can pack in an excursion to the <a href="ebook-42-qinghai-chi15.xhtml#ref-51c2fb8203c75d4c1d4bf80b2931ca89">Source of the Yellow River</a>.</p>
                <p class="box-body-text">In Xiàdàwǔ the starting point for the <em>kora</em> (holy hike) path is at Guru Gompa (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">格日寺; </span></span>Gērì Sì), and from here follow the road east. After three days the road peters out near Xuěshān (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">雪山</span></span>), from where you can hitch a ride to Mǎqìn. If you intend to continue past Xuěshān you’ll need to ask a local to show you the <em>kora</em> path. In Xiàdàwǔ, a guide costs ¥150 to ¥200 per day, and it’s about the same price for a packhorse or yak. You'll need to be fully sufficient and bring a tent, sleeping bag etc.</p>

          <p class="flush-left">For three decades Golmud (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">格尔木; </span></span>Gé'ěrmù) faithfully served overlanders as the last jumping-off point before Lhasa. Bedraggled backpackers hung around the city’s truck depot trying to negotiate a lift to the ‘Roof of the World’. But since the completion of the Qīnghǎi–Tibet Railway, this lonesome backwater has become even less important, as most Tibet-bound travellers board the train elsewhere and blow right through town. Today it’s mostly of use to travellers trying to get between Lhasa and Dūnhuáng (in Gānsù) or Huātǔgōu (en route to Xīnjiāng).</p>

The town isn't much more than two streets but there are a couple of good hotels and eating options. Remember this area is over 4000m high so altitude sickness is a real risk. Consider coming from Yùshù (3680m) rather than Xīníng (2275m) so you don’t have to ascend too much in one go. Temperatures in Mǎduō can drop to near zero even in summer so come prepared.</p>

There’s nowhere to stay or eat, so most people visit as a day trip from Mǎduō.

If you want to get to the very-hard-to-find true source of the Yellow River you’ll need a two-day round trip from Mǎduō (sleeping in the 4WD or camping) that includes some hiking and will cost around ¥3000 per vehicle, assuming you can find a driver willing to take you.
