 <h2>Southwest Xīnjiāng – Kashgaria</h2>
 <div>
 
 <p class="flush-left">The Uighurs’ heartland is the southwest of Xīnjiāng, known as Kashgaria, the rough but mellifluous-sounding historical name for the western Tarim Basin. Consisting of a ring of oases lined with poplar trees, it was a major Silk Road hub and has bristled with activity for more than 2000 years, with the weekly bazaars remaining the centre of life here to this day.</p>
 <p class="body-text">The centre of the region is undoubtedly the ancient city of Kashgar, one of the absolute highlights of any visit to Xīnjiāng. Another highlight is the breathtaking scenery along the Karakoram Hwy between Kashgar and remote Tashkurgan: neither should be missed.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">Locked away in the westernmost corner of China, closer to Tehran and Damascus than to Běijīng, Kashgar (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">喀什; </span></span>Kāshí) has been the epicentre of regional trade and cultural exchange for more than two millennia.</p>
 <p class="body-text">In recent years, modernity has swept through Kashgar, bringing waves of Han migrant workers and huge swathes of the old city have been bulldozed in the name of ‘progress’. Only a tiny section of the 'real' Old Town remains today, and is unlikely to survive for much longer.</p>
 <p class="body-text">Yet, in the face of these changes, the spirit of Kashgar lives on. Uighur craftsmen and artisans still hammer and chisel away as they have done for centuries, traders haggle over deals in the boisterous bazaars and donkey carts still trundle their way through the narrow alleyways. Do not miss the city's Sunday livestock market, which remains a fascinating sight, no matter how many tour buses roll up.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">No visit to Kashgar is complete without a trip to the Livestock Market, which takes place once a week on Sunday. The day begins with Uighur farmers and herders trekking into the city from nearby villages. By lunchtime, just about every saleable sheep, camel, horse, cow and donkey within 50km has been squeezed through the bazaar gates. It’s dusty, smelly and crowded, and most people find it wonderful, though some visitors may find the treatment of the animals upsetting.</p>
 
 
 <p class="body-text">Trading at the market is swift and boisterous between the old traders; animals are carefully inspected and haggling is done with finger motions. Keep an ear out for the phrase ‘<em>Bosh-bosh!</em>’ (‘Coming through!’) or you risk being ploughed over by a cartload of fat-tailed sheep.</p>
 <p class="body-text">A taxi here costs ¥25 to ¥30; it’s a good idea to pay it to wait for your return. Alternatively take bus number 13 or 23 from the Sunday Bazaar. Tour buses usually arrive in the morning, so consider an early afternoon visit, or come first thing for good light and fewer crowds. A few simple stalls offer delicious hot <em>samsa</em> (lamb meat buns) if you get peckish.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">On the northeastern outskirts of town is the Abakh Hoja Mausoleum, a 3-hectare complex built by the Khoja family who ruled the region in the 17th and 18th centuries. Widely considered the holiest Muslim site in Xīnjiāng, it's a major pilgrimage destination and a beautiful piece of Islamic architecture well worth a visit.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">Kashgar’s main bazaar is open every day but really kicks it up a gear on Sunday. Step through the jam-packed entrance and allow your five senses to guide you through the market; spices and teas are an obvious highlight, as are silk, <em>doppa</em> (traditional Uighur hats) and carpets, all of which can be seen in abundance. Of the variety, here locals joke that only chicken milk cannot be found amid this mercantile chaos.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">The Old Town is the soul of Kashgar, and as such the Chinese government has spent much of the past two decades knocking it down block by block and building a modern, soulless replacement. Yet it's still possible to see some of the remaining alleyways: check out the neighbourhood near Donghai Lake in the eastern part of the city. Around Jiefang Lu there are also alleys lined with Uighur workshops and adobe houses that have withstood the passage of time.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">The yellow-tiled Id Kah Mosque, which dates from 1442, is the spiritual and physical heart of the city. Enormous (it's the largest mosque in Xīnjiāng), its courtyard and gardens can hold 20,000 people during the annual Qurban Baiyram. Also known as Eid, celebrations fall in June for the next few years. Non-Muslims may enter, but not during prayer time. Dress modestly, including a headscarf for women. Take off your shoes if entering carpeted areas and be discreet when taking photos.</p>

 <h3>SHIPTON’S ARCH</h3>

 <p class="box-flush-left">This extraordinary natural rock arch (the rather prosaic Uighur name means simply ‘mountain with a hole in it’) is one of the tallest on earth. The first Westerner to describe it was Eric Shipton, the last British consul-general in Kashgar, during his visit to the region in 1947. Successive expeditions attempted to find it without success until a team from <em>National Geographic</em> rediscovered the arch in 2000. Located 80km northwest of Kashgar, it's a half-day excursion from Kashgar.</p>
 
 
 <p class="box-flush-left">The first part of the trip involves an hour’s drive towards the Irkeshtam Pass, followed by another 20km ride and then a 45-minute hike through a sublimely lunar landscape, hemmed in on all sides by sheer cliffs. At times you'll be scrambling through the narrowest part of the gorge over small ladders and staircases, until your final ascent to the arch itself, which takes you up a long wooden staircase. Kashgar-based tour operators can arrange a day trip with guide for ¥600 to ¥800, or you can simply take a taxi and walk from the car park yourself, as the route is well signposted. Bring sturdy shoes, a sun hat and water. For the best light and the smallest crowds, go early in the morning or late in the afternoon.</p>

For a real challenge, consider cycling the Karakoram Hwy: normally travellers get a lift to Tashkurgan with their bikes and then cycle back down to Kashgar over three days.</p>

 <p class="box-body-text">Uighurs boast endless varieties of <em>laghman</em> (pulled noodles; <em>lāmiàn</em> in Chinese), though the usual topping is a combination of mutton, peppers, tomatoes, eggplant and garlic shoots. <em>Suoman</em> are torn noodle squares fried with tomatoes, peppers, garlic and meat, and <em>suoman goshsiz</em> are the vegetarian variety. <em>Suoman</em> can be quite spicy, so ask for <em>lazasiz</em> (without peppers) if you prefer a milder version. <em>Dapanji</em> (literally 'big plate chicken') is a local speciality that is now a common dish all over China: it's a chicken stew that also contains red peppers, onions, potatoes, chilli, garlic, ginger and sometimes Sichuan peppers, and is most commonly served with noodles. The pieces of chicken contain bones, however, so eat carefully!</p>
 <p class="box-body-text">Kebabs are another staple and are generally of a much better standard than the <em>shashlyk</em> of the Central Asian republics, though locals prize the fattiest cuts of meat far more than the leaner chunks, which means that some visitors will prefer to ask specifically for no fat. <em>Jiger</em> (liver) kebabs are ideal for this. <em>Tonor</em> kebabs are larger and baked in an oven <em>tonor</em> (tandoori) style. True kebab connoisseurs insist on <em>kovurgah kebab</em> or <em>bel kebab,</em> made from rib and waist meat respectively. Most are flavoured with <em>zir</em> (cumin), and then wrapped in bread and squeezed, releasing the juice onto the bread.</p>
 <p class="box-body-text"><em>Naan</em> (bread) is another favourite staple and irresistible when straight out of the oven and sprinkled with poppy seeds, sesame seeds or fennel. Most Uighur restaurants serve small cartons of delicious <em>ketik</em> (yoghurt) to accompany your meal.</p>
 <p class="box-body-text">Other snacks include <em>serik ash</em> (yellow, meatless noodles), <em>nokot</em> (chickpeas), <em>pintang</em> (meat and vegetable soup) and <em>gang pan</em> (rice with vegetables and meat). <em>Opke</em> is a broth of bobbing goats' heads and coiled, stuffed intestines, while <em>laohu cai</em> (tiger salad) is the region's most popular salad, a mix of raw onions, red pepper, green chillies and tomato.</p>
 <p class="box-body-text"><em>Samsas</em> (baked mutton dumplings) are available everywhere, but the meat-to-fat ratio varies wildly. Hotan and Kashgar offer huge meat pies called <em>daman</em> or <em>gosh girde</em>.</p>
 <p class="box-body-text">For dessert, try <em>morozhenoe</em> (vanilla ice cream churned in iced wooden barrels), <em>kharsen meghriz</em> (fried dough balls filled with sugar, raisins and walnuts, also known as <em>chiker koimak</em>) or <em>dogh</em> (sometimes known as <em>doghap</em>), a delicious mix of shaved ice, syrup, yoghurt and iced water. As with all ice-based food, try this at your own risk. <em>Tangzaza</em> are triangles of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo leaves covered in syrup.</p>
 <p class="box-body-text">Anyone with a sweet tooth should look for carts selling <em>matang</em> (walnut fruit loaf) and <em>sokmak,</em> a delicious paste of walnuts, raisins, almonds and sugar, sold by the 500g jar (¥20 to ¥30) at honey and nut stalls. It’s fine to ask for a free sample.</p>
 <p class="box-body-text">Xīnjiāng is justly famous for its fruit, whether it be <em>uruk</em> (apricots), <em>uzum</em> (grapes), <em>tawuz</em> (watermelon), <em>khoghun</em> (sweet melon) or <em>yimish</em> (raisins). The best grapes come from Turpan; the sweetest melons from Hāmì. Markets groan with the stuff from July to September.</p>
 <p class="box-body-text">Meals are washed down with <em>kok chai</em> (green tea), often laced with nutmeg or rose petals. The one local beer worth going out of your way for is bottled Xīnjiāng Black Beer, a dark lager-style brew, though note that most Uighur restaurants will not serve alcohol of any sort – you'll often need to go to a Chinese-run establishment if you want a drink.</p>

 <h3>BORDER CROSSINGS</h3>
 <div>
 <h3>TO KYRGYZSTAN</h3>
 
 <p class="box-flush-left">There are two passes into Kyrgyzstan: the Torugart Pass, which leads to Naryn and then Bishkek in the north; and the Irkeshtam Pass, which goes to Osh in the south.</p>
 <p class="box-body-text">Going through the Irkeshtam Pass and on to Osh is straightforward, with a sleeper bus leaving Kashgar’s <a href="ebook-38-xinjiang-chi15a.xhtml#ref-04f3a1f44a958f5b31bcff224c21d0da">international bus station</a> at 9am on Monday and Thursday. You can also hire a car through a Kashgar agency, though no special permits or guides are needed for this route.</p>
 <p class="box-body-text">Crossing the Torugart Pass requires more red tape, for which you will need a travel agency’s help. You will also need to have arranged transport on the Kyrgyz side, which travel agents can arrange with their contacts in Naryn or Bishkek. The pass is open year-round to foreigners, though taxis cannot go here; only cars with permits allowing them to make the journey may pass.</p>
 <p class="box-body-text">Most travellers no longer need a visa to enter Kyrgyzstan, so the red tape is at least simplified in this respect.</p>
 
 </div>
 <div>
 <h3>TO PAKISTAN</h3>
 
 <p class="box-flush-left">Trips from Kashgar to Sost are done in two stages – there is no direct bus. Take one of the two daily buses to Tashkurgan from Kashgar's <a href="ebook-38-xinjiang-chi15a.xhtml#ref-700c02b3853f11bebf2ceb6d4b6bcc90">local bus station</a>, and then stay overnight at Tashkurgan, before continuing at 9.30am the following morning for the bus to Sost (which runs only Monday to Friday, as the pass is closed at weekends).</p>
 <p class="box-body-text">Officially, the border opens daily between 1 April and 1 December. However, the border can open late or close early depending on conditions at the Khunjerab Pass, and is always closed on Saturdays and Sundays. The Chinese customs and immigration formalities are done at just beyond Tashkurgan (3km down the road towards Pakistan). Then it’s 126km to the last checkpost at Khunjerab Pass, the actual border, where your documents are checked again before you head into Pakistan. Pakistan immigration formalities are performed at Sost. Pakistani visas are no longer available to tourists on arrival (and visas are difficult to get in Běijīng), so the safest option is to arrive in China with a visa obtained in your home country. Check the current situation as this could change.</p>

 <h3>TO TAJIKISTAN</h3>
 
 <p class="box-flush-left">The 4362m Qolma (Kulma) Pass linking Kashgar with Murghab (via Tashkurgan) opened in 2004 to local traders, but sadly remains closed to foreign travellers, even if you already have a Tajik visa.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">The Karakoram Hwy (KKH; <span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">中巴公路; </span></span>Zhōngbā Gōnglù) over the Khunjerab Pass (4800m) is one of the world’s most spectacular roads and China’s gateway to Pakistan. For centuries this route was used by caravans plodding down the Silk Road. Khunjerab means ‘valley of blood’ as local bandits used to take advantage of the terrain to slaughter merchants and plunder their wares. Today, it's a far more welcoming place, not to mention an easier journey, with a new road and a high-speed rail link to Pakistan under construction at the time of writing. Whatever you do in Xīnjiāng, do not miss this incredible journey.</p>
 <p class="body-text">The main (and practically the only) town between Kashgar and Pakistan is Tashkurgan, a surprisingly modern and sprawling town with a devastatingly beautiful mountain setting. This is where the bus journey to Pakistan begins, and it's also as far as most travellers not entering Pakistan itself are able to go.</p>
 
 </div>
 <div>
 <h4>Kashgar to Tashkurgan</h4>
 
 <p class="flush-left">Travelling up the KKH to Tashkurgan is a highlight of Kashgaria and of China as a whole. The journey begins with a one-hour drive through the Kashgar oasis to <strong>Upal</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">乌帕尔; </span></span>Wùpà’ěr), where most vehicles stop for breakfast, especially during the interesting Monday market. The renovated <span class="name">Tomb of Mahmud Kashgari</span> <span class="practicalities">(</span><span class="practicalities">adult ¥30</span><span class="practicalities">)</span>, a beloved local 11th-century scholar, traveller and writer, is a potential excursion but it’s far from unmissable. The tomb is about 2.5km from the market on the edge of Upal hill.</p>
 <p class="body-text">Two hours from Kashgar, you enter the canyon of the Ghez River (Ghez Darya in Uighur), with its dramatic claret-red sandstone walls. Ghez itself is a major checkpoint; photographing soldiers or buildings is strictly prohibited. At the top of the canyon, 3½ hours above the plain, you pop out into a huge wet plateau ringed with mountains of sand, part of the Sarikol Pamir, and aptly called Kumtagh (Sand Mountain) by locals.</p>
 <p class="body-text">Soon Kongur Mountain (Gōnggé’ěr Shān; 7719m) rises up on the left side of the road, followed by heavily glaciered Muztagh Ata (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">慕士塔格峰; </span></span>Mùshìtǎgé Fēng; 7546m). The main stopping point for views is <strong>Karakul Lake</strong>, a glittering mirror of glacial peaks 194km from Kashgar. From here you can hike into the hills or circumnavigate the lake.</p>
 <p class="body-text">The journey climbs to a pass offering fine views, then meanders through high mountain pastures dotted with grazing camels and yaks, before passing the turn-off to the Qolma Pass (currently closed to foreigners), which leads into neighbouring Tajikistan. The final major town on the Chinese side is <strong>Tashkurgan</strong> at 3600m. You could easily kill a couple of hours wandering the streets and visiting the small museum at the <span class="name">Folk Culture Centre</span> <span class="practicalities">(</span><span class="practicalities">adult ¥30</span><span class="practicalities">; </span><img alt="icon-hoursgif" class="prac-icon" src="images/icon-hours.gif"/><samp class="font-prac-icon">h</samp><span class="practicalities">10am-5pm</span><span class="practicalities">)</span> at the central crossroads (marked by the eagle statue).</p>
 <p class="body-text">On the outskirts of town, close to the river, is <span class="name">Tashkurgan Fort</span> <span class="practicalities">(</span><span class="practicalities"><span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">石头城</span></span>, Shítóuchéng</span> <span class="practicalities">adult ¥30</span><span class="practicalities">)</span>, the 1400-year-old stone (<em>tash</em>) fortifications (<em>kurgan</em>) of which give the town its name. The ruins were one of the filming locations for the movie <em>The Kite Runner</em>. The boggy valley below is dotted with Tajik yurts in summer and offers some spectacular views back towards the fort from a touristy boardwalk that rises above the waterlogged valley floor.</p>
 <p class="body-text">Some travellers head up to the Khunjerab Pass for a photo opportunity on the actual Pakistan–China border. Note that you need a border permit (available in Kashgar) and a guide, which most tour agencies can arrange. Travelling into Pakistan itself is perfectly possible if you have a valid visa, though always check in Kashagr or Islamabad whether the pass is open before you set out.</p>
 
 <div class="practical-tip">
 <h3>ADVANCE PLANNING</h3>
 
 <p class="box-flush-left">There are almost no settlements on the road between Kashgar and Tashkurgan, so be sure to take everything you need, including warm clothing, food and drink. If you take a bus, be aware that anything stowed on the bus roof will be unavailable during the journey. Check the state of the highway well ahead of time, as heavy snows and landslides can close it at almost any time. If you plan to continue into Pakistan, it's essential to have a Pakistani visa already in your passport. To get past the first checkpoint at Ghez, you'll need to have a permit: these can be arranged by any travel agency in Kashgar, they're free and you'll just need to submit a copy of your passport's photo page to allow them to get the permit, which is issued on the spot.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">Within China, many travellers head up the highway at least to Tashkurgan. It’s possible to do a day trip to Karakul Lake and back but it’s much better to spend a night or two up in these gorgeous mountains either camping and trekking or just in a hotel in Tashkurgan. Some travellers also hire bikes in Kashgar: get a lift up to Tashkurgan and cycle back for an exciting three-day journey.</p>

Famed for its perfect plate-glass reflections of the surrounding mountains, it's a popular overnight stop between Kashgar and Tashkurgan where travellers can stay in traditional yurts or stone huts as guests of local families. This is best organised through a travel agency.</p>

 <h3>THE SILK ROAD</h3>
 
 <p class="box-flush-left">Nomadic trading routes across Asia and Europe had existed for thousands of years but what we now call the Silk Road, an intercontinental network connecting the East and West, began to take shape in the 2nd century BC. At the time, the Mediterranean had already been linked to Central Asia by Alexander the Great (and his Roman successors), and China, in its need to defend itself from marauding Xiongnu, was about to do its part.</p>
 <p class="box-body-text">In 138 BC, the Emperor Wudi sent envoy Zhang Qian to negotiate an alliance with the Yuezhi, a Central Asian people being driven west by the Xiongnu. On his return (after much hardship which included being kidnapped twice), Zhang piqued the emperor’s interest with tales of wealthy neighbouring kingdoms, powerful horses, and trade of Chinese goods, including silk, that had already reached these regions. Over the next two centuries, the Han experienced endless setbacks as they sought to defeat the Xiongnu and secure safe passage from Gānsù through Xīnjiāng, but eventually formal trade with Central Asia was established.</p>
 <p class="box-body-text">Owing as much to continuous political instability as geographical challenges, there was never any one route that goods travelled along, much less a road; the name Silk Road was coined in 1877 by German geographer Ferdinand von Richtofen. The loose, fragile and often dangerous network of ancient times had its Chinese start in Cháng'ān (modern Xī'ān) and from there proceeded up the Héxī Corridor to Dūnhuáng. At this great oasis town it split north and south to circumvent the unforgiving Taklamakan Desert. The routes then met again at Kashgar, where they once more split to cross the high, snowy Pamirs, Karakorum and Tiān Shān Mountains to connect with Samarkand (and eventually Iran and Constantinople), India and the Russian Volga.</p>
 <p class="box-body-text">Despite the distances that goods could reach, almost all trade was small scale and local: large caravan teams were rare unless travelling as official envoys, and goods were seldom carried more than a few hundred kilometres by any one group. An average day’s journey was 15km to 20km and traders often made lengthy stops at oasis towns to plan their next stage.</p>
 <p class="box-body-text">In addition to silk, which was often used as currency, goods included spices, nuts, fruit, metals, leather products, chemicals, glass, paper, precious gems, gold, ivory, porcelain and exotic animals, including the powerful Ferghana horse much prized by the Chinese. It was the exchange of ideas, technology and culture, however, that is the true legacy of the Silk Road.</p>
 <p class="box-body-text">Buddhism entered China via the Silk Road, and later allowed Chinese monks to travel to Gandhara and India for direct study and the gathering of primary texts. In copying Buddhist cave art, which originated in India, the Chinese created some of the finest examples in locations such as Mogao and Kizil. Going in the other direction, fine Chinese tri-coloured pottery had influence across Central Asia, the Middle East and Europe.</p>
 <p class="box-body-text">The heyday of Silk Road trade began in the 6th century under the stable but militarily strong Tang dynasty. Cháng'ān became one of the most cosmopolitan capitals in the world, with an estimated 5000 foreigners, including Indians, Turks, Iranians, Japanese and Koreans permanently settled there. Trade declined and then stabilised under Mongolian rule of China, but by the 14th century, sea routes were supplanting the slow and still dangerous overland routes. By the 16th century, the Silk Road network had reverted to obscure local trading and never recovered its former importance.</p>
 <p class="box-body-text">In June 2014, at the behest of China, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, Unesco listed the 5000km Tiān Shān Corridor of the Silk Road as World Heritage. The designation highlights not just the obvious pagodas, palaces, cave art and remains of the Great Wall (including beacon towers and forts), but also the caravanserai and way stations that provided relief and lodging for traders. Hopefully in the coming years the listing will encourage more conservation and research and not be seen as a license for unfettered tourist development.</p>

 <p class="info-body-text">From Tashkurgan, there are two daily buses to Kashgar at 9.30am and 11.30am, and there's occasionally a third bus at 12.30pm. There is also a daily bus from Tashkurgan to Sost in Pakistan (¥225, eight hours) at 9.30am.

 <h2>Southern Silk Road</h2>
 <div>
 
 <p class="flush-left">The Silk Road east of Kashgar splits into two threads in the face of the Taklamakan Desert, the second-largest sandy desert in the world. The northern thread follows the modern road and railway to Kuqa and Turpan. The southern road charts a more remote course between desert sands and the towering Pamir and Kunlun mountain ranges.</p>
 <p class="body-text">This off-the-grid journey takes you far into the Uighur heartland, as well as deep into the ancient multi-ethnic heritage of the region. You're as likely to come across a centuries-old tiled mosque as the ruins of a Buddhist pagoda from the 4th century.</p>
 <p class="body-text">It’s possible to visit the southern towns as a multiday trip from Kashgar before crossing the Taklamakan Desert to Ürümqi, or as part of a rugged backdoor route into Tibet or Qīnghǎi.</p>
 
 </div>
 <div>
 <h3 class="heading-3" id="ref-yengisar">Yengisar</h3>
 
 <p class="flush-left">The tiny town of <strong>Yengisar</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">英吉沙; </span></span>Yīngjíshā) is synonymous with knife production. A lesser-known but more sensitive fact is it’s the birthplace of the Uighur’s icon of nationalism, Isa Yusuf Alptekin (1901–95), the leader of the First East Turkestan Republic in Kashgar, who died in exile in Istanbul. Neither of these facts are particularly popular with the Chinese government, and the town has suffered badly in the past few years and feels today like a rather sad backwater.</p>
 <p class="body-text">There are dozens of knife shops here, most of them strung along the highway; ask for the ‘knife factories’ (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">小刀厂; </span></span><em>xiǎodāochǎng</em> in Chinese; <em>pichak chilik karakhana</em> in Uighur). Traditionally each worker makes the blade, handle and inlays by hand, using only the most basic tools, though many knives on sale here are now factory produced and brought in from elsewhere, so be sure you're buying a real handmade knife if you decide to stop here. Another thing to consider is that knives are prohibited in luggage on buses, trains and planes (even in the hold), so you’ll have to ship them home – ask the vendors about this, as they're used to arranging this as part of a knife sale.</p>
 <p class="body-text">It's currently not possible for foreigners to stay the night in Yengisar, so you'll have to limit your visit to a day trip, or to a quick stop by bus between Kashgar and Yarkand.</p>
 <p class="body-text">Buses pass through the town regularly en route between Yarkand (¥30, 1½ hours) and Kashgar (¥15, 1½ hours). To get to the knife sellers from the main bus station, hop in a taxi (¥5) for the 3km trip. They are right on the main road, so you’ll pass right by them on the journey to or from Yarkand, and can simply ask the driver to let you out there.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">Charklik (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">若羌; </span></span>Ruòqiāng) may be a soulless, modern Chinese town, but intrepid history buffs may find themselves heading here as there are several ancient city ruins nearby. The most famous is remote Lóulán (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">楼兰</span></span>), located some 260km northeast of Charklik, but you’ll probably have to join a very pricey group tour to visit as permits can run into the thousands of dollars. The ruined fortress and stupa of Miran (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">米兰</span></span>) is closer, located just 7km southeast of the modern town of Miran (which is 85km northwest of Charklik). Permits here are more reasonable, being a few hundred rénmínbì for a group. Contact <strong>CITS</strong> (<a href="http://www.xinjiangtour.com">www.xinjiangtour.com</a>) in Ürümqi for help with the paperwork.</p>
 <p class="body-text">At the time of writing, no hotels in town were accepting foreigners, though this may change, and arrangements can certainly be made by CITS or other travel agencies.</p>
 <p class="body-text">From Charklik, you can complete the Taklamakan loop by taking one of several daily buses to Korla (¥128, four hours). Alternatively, you can continue east over the mountains to Golmud in Qīnghǎi on a daily sleeper bus (¥332, 18 hours). There's also a 7am bus each day that heads along the Southern Silk Road to Hotan (¥210, 13 hours).</p>

 <p class="flush-left">An ancient Silk Road city with a long and illustrious history, Hotan (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">和田; </span></span>Hétián) is nevertheless moving quickly and relentlessly into the modern age. Indeed, today it can be hard at first to imagine that this was once the focal point of the ancient kingdom of Khotan (224 BC to AD 1006), or that later it became an important junction of the southern Silk Road from where trade routes led into India.</p>
 <p class="body-text">But get off the busy main avenues and enter the fabulous bazaar or wonderfully varied night market and you'll quickly get a sense of this important Uighur city's history and culture. The main reason to come here today is to explore several ancient sites around the city, or simply to shop for jade, silk, carpets and all manner of other things at Hotan's various markets.</p>
 
 </div>
 <div class="history">
 <h3>History</h3>
 
 <p class="flush-left">New religions first entered Xīnjiāng (and China) through Hotan, and as with Buddhism (which arrived around 84 BC), they became well established. In fact, the Khotan Kingdom was a centre for Buddhist translation and study, and famous Chinese monks such as Faxian and Xuan Zang who passed through in the 5th and 7th centuries, respectively, commented favourably on the wealth and size of Khotan's Buddhist community. In 1006, Khotan was conquered by the Muslim Karakhanids and slowly Islam became the dominant cultural force. In the 13th century, Marco Polo visited and reported that the entire population followed the new religion.</p>
 <p class="body-text">Hotan has also long been known as the epicentre of the central Asian and Chinese jade trade. Locally unearthed jade artefacts have been dated to around 5000 BC and it is believed that Hotan attracted Chinese traders along the Jade Road even before they headed westward to open up the Silk Road. In the 5th century AD, the Hotanese were also the first non-Han to learn the secret of Chinese silk making, and later established themselves as the region’s foremost carpet weavers.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">Hotan’s most popular attraction is its weekly Sunday market. The covered market bustles every day of the week, but on Sundays it swamps the northeast part of town, reaching fever pitch between noon and 2pm Xīnjiāng time. The most interesting parts are the <em>doppi</em> (skullcap) bazaar, the colourful <em>atlas</em> (tie-dyed, handwoven silk) cloth to the right of the main entrance and the <em>gilim</em> (carpet) bazaar, across the road. Nearby Juma Lu (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">加买路</span></span>) is filled with traditional medicine and spice shops.</p>

The most interesting are those of Melikawat, 25km south of town, a Tang dynasty settlement with wind-eroded walls, Buddhist stupas and the remains of pottery kilns. Some scholars believe Melikawat was a capital city of the Yutian state (206 BC to AD 907), an Indo-European civilisation that thrived during the height of the Silk Road. A taxi should cost about ¥100 to Melikawat.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">This 9m-tall ruin is the largest of the southern Silk Road Buddhist stupas yet discovered. Built between the 3rd and 5th centuries for a wealthy Khotanese monastery, it might have been visited by the Chinese monk Faxian in AD 401 on his way to India. It was certainly explored by archaeologist Aurel Stein, who excavated the site in 1901, and declared it a magnificent ruin. Stein's original work also uncovered 91 large Buddhist statues (now all sadly gone).</p>
 
 
 <p class="body-text">Rawaq is about 50km north of Hotan and it's best to go with a guide who knows the site, as taxi drivers have been known to get lost.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">A few kilometres beyond Jíyà lies the tomb complex of Imam Asim (Tomb of Four Imams). It’s a popular pilgrimage site, particularly during May, and you’ll likely see groups of Uighurs praying and chanting at the desert shrine, which is slowly being engulfed by the Taklamakan Desert. Buses to the town of Jíyà drop you 3km from the site, from where you should be able to hire a motorised cart to take you to the site.</p>
 
 
 <p class="body-text">On Thursdays in April and May, a pilgrim market springs up by the roadside, about 2km before the tomb, and buses run directly to the site from Hotan’s east bus station.</p>

The entire north of Xīnjiāng was closed to foreigners until the 1990s, due to the proximity of the sensitive Russian, Mongolian and Kazakhstan borders, but today the region is growing fast as both a tourist and trade centre.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">Stunning Kanas Lake (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">哈纳斯湖; </span></span>Hānàsī Hú) is a long finger of water surrounded by soaring mountain peaks nestled in the southernmost reaches of the Siberian taiga ecosystem, pinched in between Mongolia, Russia and Kazakhstan. Most of the local inhabitants are Kazakh or Tuvan, though Chinese tourists (and the occasional foreigner) descend on the place in droves during the summer months. With a little effort it’s just about possible to escape the crowds, but as facilities grow and domestic travel increases, it gets harder every year. Many visitors come hoping for a cameo by the Kanas Lake Monster, China’s Nessie, who has long figured in scary stories around yurt campfires. She appears every year or two, bringing journalists and conspiracy hounds in her wake.</p>
 
 
 <p class="body-text">The whole area is only easily accessible from April to October, with ice and snow making transport difficult at other times. The gorgeous autumn colours peak around mid-September.</p>

 <h3>KANAS LAKE AND VILLAGES</h3>
 
 <p class="box-flush-left">About 160km from Bù’ěrjīn, the road comes to an end at Jiǎdēngyù, basically a collection of hotels near the entrance to the <a href="ebook-38-xinjiang-chi15a.xhtml#ref-58b0460e6eaa61465e2a824439165854">Kanas Lake Nature Reserve</a>. Buy an entrance ticket and board a tourist bus (¥100, unlimited rides, May to October only), which carries you 16km up the canyon to the tourist base. You'll need to have your passport to sign in at the park entrance.</p>
 <p class="box-body-text">At the tourist base, which is dominated by an ugly visitor complex, you can change buses to take you the final 2km to Kanas Lake. From the final stop it’s a five-minute walk to the lake. At the lakeshore you can take a speedboat ride, walk the long lakeshore boardwalk or head downstream from the dock along the river, or hike to the lookout point <strong>Guānyú Pavilion</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">观鱼亭; </span></span>Guānyú Tíng; 2030m), which takes a couple of hours each way from the lake itself – most people take a taxi to the access road and then walk up (around 45 minutes) to save time. The views from the top are incredible.</p>
 <p class="box-body-text">You can also explore Kanas Village itself, which is full of log houses and has several affordable noodle restaurants for a lunch stop. Other activities include water-rafting trips (¥200) and horse rides (per hour ¥40 to ¥60). It's even possible to take an overnight horse trek to the <strong>valley of Hémù</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">禾木</span></span>), 70km southeast of Kanas Lake, via Karakol (Black Lake, or Héi Hú). Check with the <a href="ebook-38-xinjiang-chi15a.xhtml#ref-b9a7292357704e83f3bc00d825134472">youth hostel</a> in Hémù.</p>

 <p class="info-flush-left">Kanas airport (KJI) – also confusingly known as Bù’ěrjīn airport, despite being nowhere near Bù’ěrjīn – is 50km south of the reserve. It has between one and four daily flights to and from Ürümqi (from ¥950, one hour) between June and September. From here, taxis will take you the rest of the way to the reserve (¥100, 30 minutes). At other times, you'll need to fly into Altay airport, which has year-round connections to Ürümqi.</p>
 
 
 <p class="info-flush-left">There is no public bus to the main gate at Jiǎdēngyù from Bù’ěrjīn. Buses to Hémù leave from Jiǎdēngyù but are sporadic.</p>
 
 
 <p class="info-flush-left">Shared taxis do run from Bù’ěrjīn and Jiǎdēngyù, though outside summer it may be hard to find a ride. Taxi drivers will look for you at Bù’ěrjīn’s bus station.</p>

 <p class="info-flush-left">Inside the park in high season, you're limited to the tourist bus that regularly connects the park entrance, Jiǎdēngyù and Kanas Village, following the main road along the Kanas River. There are frequent stops along the way where you can get out for photo opportunities. Early and late in the season (April, May, September and October), private drivers are normally permitted to enter the park. In peak summer, your only alternative is the few taxis that have permission to operate in the park.</p>

 <p class="flush-left">Located on the historic border between the Chinese and Russian empires, Yīníng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">伊宁; </span></span>Yili or Gulja) has long been subject to a tug-of-war between the two sides. The city was occupied by Russian troops between 1872 and 1881, and in 1962 there were major Sino–Soviet clashes along the Ili River (Yīlí Hé). There are no unmissable sights here but it’s a pleasant, little-visited stop on route to Sayram Lake, or a good place to break an overland journey to Kazakhstan.</p>
 <p class="body-text">In 2014, the stadium in Yīníng was the site of a mass trial in which 55 Uighurs were charged with terrorist activities. At least one death sentence was handed down. A similar mass trial was held in 1997 and is the subject of Nick Holdstead's book <em>The Tree That Bleeds</em>.</p>

The gender-segregated dorms and one private room share the communal bathrooms and squat toilets, while extras include laundry (¥10 per load), bike rental and a book exchange.</p>
 
 
 <p class="body-text">The hostel is on the northern edge of a bizarre set of concentric streets that form a giant hexagon, which at least makes it easy to find on any mapping app. It's a 10-minute walk from the bus station: turn left onto the main road and then turn left onto Gongren Lu, then take the third left and keep going until you find the hostel on your right.</p>
