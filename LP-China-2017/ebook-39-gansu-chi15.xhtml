 <h3>Why Go?</h3>
<p class="flush-left">Synonymous with the Silk Road, the slender province of Gānsù (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">甘肃</span></span>) flows east to west along the Héxī Corridor, the gap through which goods and ideas once streamed between China and Central Asia. The constant flow of commerce left Buddhist statues, beacon towers, forts, chunks of the Great Wall and ancient trading towns in its wake. Gānsù offers an entrancingly rich cultural and geographic diversity. Historians immerse themselves in Silk Road lore, art aficionados swoon before the wealth of Buddhist paintings and sculptures, while adventurers hike through desert rockland, ascend sand dunes and tread along high-mountain paths well worn by Tibetan nomads. The ethnic diversity is equally astonishing: throughout the province, the local Hui Muslims act as though the Silk Road lives on; in Xiàhé and Lángmùsì a pronounced Tibetan disposition holds sway, while other minority groups such as the Bao’an and Dongxiang join in the colourful minority patchwork.</p>

<div class="history">
 <h3>History</h3>
<p class="flush-left">Although the Qin dynasty had a toehold on eastern Gānsù, the first significant push west along the Héxī Corridor came with the Han dynasty. An imperial envoy, Zhang Qian (Chang Ch’ien), was dispatched to seek trading partners and returned with detailed reports of Central Asia and the route that would become known as the Silk Road. The Han extended the Great Wall through the Héxī Corridor, expanding their empire in the process. As trade along the Silk Road grew, so did the small way stations set up along its route; these grew into towns and cities that form the major population centres of modern Gānsù. The stream of traders from lands east and west also left their mark in the incredible diversity of modern Gānsù. The Buddhist grottoes at Mògāo, Màijī Shān and elsewhere are testament to the great flourishing of religious and artistic schools along the Silk Road.</p>
<p class="body-text">The mixing of cultures in Gānsù eventually led to serious tensions, which culminated in the Muslim rebellions of 1862 to 1877. The conflict left millions dead and virtually wiped out Gānsù’s Muslim population. Ethnic tensions have never fully left the province as the pro-Tibetan demonstrations in Xiàhé in 2008 and 2012 illustrate.</p>
<p class="body-text">Though remote from the investment banks and manufacturing hubs along the east coast of China, Gānsù is not a poor province. Gross Domestic Product has been growing at a higher rate than the already blistering national average and massive investments in wind energy are fuelling the transformation of both the natural and urban landscapes.</p>
</div>
<div class="history">
 <h3>Climate</h3>
<p class="flush-left">Gānsù rarely sees any rain outside of the southern regions, and dust storms can whip up, particularly in the spring. Winters are nippy from November to March. Summer temperatures in the desert regions can top 40°C. It's important to keep well hydrated and pack adequate skin protection.</p>
</div>
<div class="info">
<p class="info-heading-1 getting-there-away"><samp class="font-icon">8</samp>Getting There &amp; Away</p>
<p class="info-flush-left">Lánzhōu airport has flights around the country; other airports such as Dūnhuáng, Jiāyùguān and outside Xiàhé only have a handful of flights to major cities, with fewer flights in the winter.</p>
</div>
<div class="info">
<p class="info-heading-1 getting-around"><samp class="font-icon">8</samp>Getting Around</p>
<p class="info-flush-left">Both trains and buses are handy for connecting the province’s Silk Road sights, and the addition of a new high-speed rail linking Lánzhōu with Ürümqi in Xīnjiāng has cut the time between cities significantly. In southern Gānsù you are largely at the mercy of buses, though upgrades to highways in recent years have cut travel times significantly.</p>

<p class="flush-left">At China’s cartographic bullseye, Lánzhōu (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">兰州</span></span>) marks the halfway point for overlanders trekking across the country. Growing up on a strategic stretch of the Yellow River (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">黄河; </span></span>Huáng Hé), and sitting between competing Chinese and Central Asian empires, Gānsù’s elongated capital city frequently changed hands, reflected today in its mix of ethnic groups and cultures. These days, Lánzhōu is perhaps most well known for its favourite food – Lánzhōu beef noodles (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">牛肉拉面; </span></span><em>niúròu lāmiàn</em>) – and with several excellent night markets, this is an excellent place to sample the delights of Chinese Silk Road fare. Lánzhōu's reputation as being hazy and traffic-choked is also changing with the building of a new metro, which should be open by the time you read this.</p>

<p class="box-flush-left">With its relative inaccessibility, Bǐnglíng Sì is one of the few Buddhist grottoes in China to have survived the tumultuous 20th century unscathed. Which is a good thing, as during a period spanning 1600 years, sculptors dangling from ropes carved 183 niches and sculptures into the porous rock of steep canyon walls. The cave art can’t compare to Dūnhuáng, but the setting, few tourists and the remarkable terraced landscapes you pass getting here make Bǐnglíng Sì unmissable.</p>
<p class="box-flush-left">Today the cliffs are isolated by the waters of the Liújiāxiá Reservoir (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">劉家峽水庫; </span></span>Liújiāxiá Shuǐkù) on the Yellow River and hemmed in by a ring of dramatic rock citadels.</p>
<p class="box-body-text">The star is the 27m-high seated <strong>statue of Maitreya</strong>, the future Buddha, but some of the smaller, sway-hipped Bodhisattvas and guardians, bearing an obvious Indian influence, are equally exquisite.</p>
<p class="box-body-text">As you loop around past the Maitreya cave, consider hiking 2.5km further up the impressive canyon to a small <strong>Tibetan monastery</strong>. There might also be 4WDs running the route.</p>
<p class="box-body-text">You can visit Bǐnglíng Sì as a day trip from Lánzhōu or en route to Xiàhé via Línxià. Take a boat or taxi from the town of Liújiāxiá. Frequent buses from Lánzhōu’s west bus station (¥20, 2½ hours) run to Liújiāxiá bus station. From there, you will need to take a 10-minute taxi (¥6) to the boat ticket office at the dam (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">大坝; </span></span><em>dàbà</em>). Try to catch the earliest buses possible from Lánzhōu (starting at 7am) to avoid getting stuck on the way back. The last return bus to Lánzhōu leaves at 6.30pm.</p>
<p class="box-body-text">A covered speedboat (seating nine people) costs ¥700 for the one-hour journey. The boat ticket office will refuse to make the trip unless the boat is full, so independent travellers may have to wait for a small group to form; expect to pay around ¥150 per person in this case. In summer, you should have no trouble finding a seat, but in shoulder season, you may find yourself stranded.</p>
<p class="box-body-text">Surprisingly, the much more scenic route to the caves is by hiring a private car (¥250 return). Out of Liújiāxiá, the road runs high into the rugged hills above the reservoir, and for 90 minutes you will twist and turn, dip and rise through a wonderland of corn-growing terraces laddering and layering every slope, mound, outcrop and ravine. The final descent to the green-blue reservoir, with its craggy backdrop, is sublime. Driver touts ply the bus station in Liújiāxiá; bargain hard for a good deal.</p>
<p class="box-body-text">If heading to Línxià after the grottoes, there are frequent buses (¥21, three hours) from the station at Liújiāxiá.</p>
<p class="box-body-text">You can also opt to stay overnight in Liújiāxiá for a less rushed experience.

<p class="flush-left">Lánzhōu can be a frustrating place to book accommodation, especially if you're travelling on a budget. Many budget hostels and midrange places are off limits to foreigners, including some nationwide chains. Often, places billed as hostels are actually private apartments that have been fitted out with bunk beds. There is a useful branch of <strong>Jǐnjiāng Inn</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">锦江之星; </span></span>Jǐnjiāng Zhīxīng) on Tianshui Nanlu if you get stuck.</p>

The Tibetan-inhabited areas around Xiàhé and Lángmùsì are the principal enticements here – perfect stopovers for overlanders heading to or from Sìchuān or destinations in their own right. Southwest of Lánzhōu, the inspiring vistas of the Yellow River and the Buddhist grottoes of Bǐnglíng Sì, carved out of dusty desert cliffs, remain some of the best-kept secrets in the country.</p>

<p class="flush-left">The alluring monastic town of Xiàhé (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">夏河</span></span>) attracts an astonishing band of visitors: backpack-laden students, insatiable wanderers, shaven-headed Buddhist nuns, Tibetan pilgrims in their most colourful finery, camera-toting tour groups and dusty, itinerant beggars. Most visitors are rural Tibetans, whose purpose is to pray, prostrate themselves and seek spiritual fulfilment at holy Labrang Monastery, around which Xiàhé has grown up.</p>
<p class="body-text">In an arid mountain valley at 2920m above sea level, Xiàhé has a certain rhythm about it and visitors quickly tap into its fluid motions. The rising sun sends pilgrims out to circle the 3km <em>kora</em> (pilgrim path) that rings the monastery. Crimson-clad monks shuffle into the temples to chant morning prayers. It’s easy to get swept up in the action, but some of the best moments come as you set your own pace, wandering about town or in the splendid encircling mountains.</p>

Several other buildings have their own admission fees, and tickets for those can be purchased at small ticket offices or from attendants at the entrances. In general, opening hours for the monastery's buildings are 8am to 5pm, although you can wander the grounds from very early in the morning, and many pilgrims begin walking the <em>kora</em> before dawn.</p>

<p class="flush-left">With its succession of squeaking prayer wheels (3km in total), hawks circling overhead and the throb of Tibetan longhorns resonating from the surrounding hills, Labrang is a monastery town unto itself. Many of the chapel halls are illuminated in a yellow glow by yak-butter lamps, their strong-smelling fuel scooped out from voluminous tubs. Even if Tibet is not on your itinerary, the monastery sufficiently conveys the mystique of its devout persuasions, leaving indelible impressions of a deeply sacred domain.</p>
<p class="body-text">In addition to the chapels, residences, golden-roofed temple halls and living quarters for the monks, Labrang is also home to six <em>tratsang</em> (monastic colleges or institutes), exploring esoteric Buddhism, theology, medicine, astrology and law.</p>
<p class="body-text">Labrang Monastery was founded in 1709 by Ngagong Tsunde (E’angzongzhe in Chinese), the first-generation Jamyang (a line of reincarnated Rinpoches or living Buddhas ranking third in importance after the Dalai and Panchen lamas), from nearby Gānjiā. The monastery is one of the six major Tibetan monasteries of the Gelugpa order (Yellow Hat sect of Tibetan Buddhism). The others are <a href="ebook-43-tibet-chi15.xhtml#ref-18d00df08f1494c5ecae0572d4974286">Ganden</a>, <a href="ebook-43-tibet-chi15.xhtml#ref-d47c252ccea5232ebec2efde489abb74">Sera</a> and <a href="ebook-43-tibet-chi15.xhtml#ref-0c5b200a287ee1999874fdf567730128">Drepung</a> monasteries near Lhasa; <a href="ebook-43-tibet-chi15.xhtml#ref-8ac37473cadcf98c9afb37db6dcc8395">Tashilhunpo Monastery</a> in Shigatse; and <a href="ebook-42-qinghai-chi15.xhtml#ref-a82f03055758b16b6eba072aa48d9be9">Kumbum Monastery</a> near Xīníng in Qīnghǎi.</p>
<p class="body-text">At its peak, Labrang housed nearly 4000 monks, but their ranks greatly declined during the Cultural Revolution. Modern Labrang is again such a popular destination for young disciples that numbers are currently capped at 1800 monks with about 1600 currently in residence, drawn from Qīnghǎi, Gānsù, Sìchuān and Inner Mongolia.</p>

 <strong class="poi-subheading">Main Buildings</strong>
 </p>
<p class="body-text">The only way to visit the interior of the most important buildings is on a tour (no photos allowed inside buildings), which generally includes the Institute of Medicine, the Manjushri Temple, the Serkung (Golden Temple) and the main Prayer Hall (Grand Sutra Hall), plus a museum of relics and yak-butter sculptures.

 <span class="practicalities">)</span> around 10.15am and 3.15pm most days, and although they give plenty to see, they can feel a bit rushed. Outside those times you can latch on to a Chinese tour, with little lost even if you don't understand the language, but be aware you must purchase the ¥40 ticket to gain entrance to any of the buildings' interiors. Even better is to show up at around 6am or 7am, when the monks come out to pray and chant. At dusk the hillside resonates with the throaty sound of sutras being chanted behind the wooden doors.</p>
<p class="body-text">
 <strong class="poi-subheading">Other Buildings</strong>
 </p>
<p class="body-text">The rest of the Labrang can be explored by walking the <strong>inner kora</strong> (pilgrim path). Although many of the temple halls are padlocked shut, there are a couple of separate smaller chapels you can visit, though they can often be closed for unexplained reasons. Some charge admission. Among the most popular are the three-storey Barkhang, the monastery's traditional printing temple, as well as the Hall of Hayagriva with its enchanting murals, and the golden <span class="anchor" id="ref-8ae6ddc7517ee4ee2847d43ac385eb96"/><span class="name">Gòngtáng Pagoda</span> <span class="practicalities">(</span><span class="practicalities"><span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">贡唐宝塔; </span></span>Gòngtáng Bǎotǎ, Gòngtáng Chörten</span> <span class="map-links">

 <h3>LíNXIà AND ITS MINORITY COMMUNITIES</h3>
<p class="box-list-a"><strong>Línxià</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">临夏; </span></span>population 202,500) is a centre of Chinese Islam settled by ancient Silk Road Muslims and now populated by their descendants. At one time known as Hézhōu (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">河州</span></span>), the city's strategic location at the junction of the Silk Road and several north–south trade routes meant it was, for centuries, an important commercial centre. These crossing roads brought Muslim teachers from Central Asia and further afield, some of whom stayed and went on to turn Línxià into an important centre for Chinese Islamic scholarship, particularly Sufism. The city itself is occasionally used by travellers (and monks) to break up the trip between Xiàhé and Lánzhōu or Qīnghǎi. Línxià is home to more than 80 mosques and <em>gǒngběi</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">拱北; </span></span>Sufi master's shrine complexes) dotted all over town.</p>
<p class="box-body-text">Spilling over a ridge high above Línxià and home to both Hui and Dongxiang minorities, the little market town of <strong>Suǒnánbà</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">锁南坝; </span></span>population 12,000) has a single street that’s a hive of activity, with locals trading livestock and occasional shepherds shooing flocks about.</p>
<p class="box-body-text">The town is sometimes also called Dōngxiāng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">东乡</span></span>) after the surrounding county. The Dongxiang people speak an Altaic language and are believed to be descendants of 13th-century immigrants from Central Asia, moved forcibly to China after Kublai Khan’s Middle East conquest.</p>
<p class="box-list-a"><strong>Dàhéjiā</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">大河家; </span></span>population 4500), with sweeping views over the Yellow River, towering red cliffs and (in summer) verdant green terraces, is a kaleidoscope of colour. The surrounding area is home to a significant population of Bao’an (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">保安族</span></span>), Muslims who speak a Mongolic language. The Bao’an are famed for producing knives and share cultural traits with the Hui and Dongxiang. Their Mongol roots come out during summer festivals, when it is possible to see displays of wrestling and horse riding.</p>
<p class="box-body-text">To Suǒnánbà, frequent minibuses (¥7, one hour) head up on the pleasant journey past terraced fields from Línxià’s east bus station.</p>
<p class="box-body-text">You can visit Dàhéjiā when travelling on the road between Línxià and Xīníng. Most buses between the two will stop here. From Línxià you can also catch a frequent minibus (¥25, three hours) from the station (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">城郊汽车站; </span></span><em>chéngjiāo qìchē zhàn</em>) on the outskirts of town.</p>

 <h3>WALK LIKE A TIBETAN</h3>
<p class="box-flush-left">Following the 3km <strong>inner kora</strong> (pilgrim path) encircling Labrang Monastery is perhaps the best approach to grasping the giant temple's layout, scale and significance. The <em>kora</em> is lined with long rows of squeaking prayer wheels, whitewashed <em>chörtens</em> (Tibetan stupas) and chapels. Tibetan pilgrims with beads in their hands and sunhats on their heads, old folk, mothers with babies and children, shabby nomads and curious visitors walk in meditative fashion clockwise along the path (called <em>zhuǎnjìngdào, ‘</em>scripture-turning way’ in Chinese), rotating prayer wheels as they go. Look also for the tiny meditation cells on the northern hillside.</p>
<p class="box-body-text">For a short hike, the more strenuous <strong>outer kora</strong> takes about an hour and climbs high above the monastery. To reach the start, head past the monastery’s western edge. About one block into the Tibetan village look for a large signpost (in Tibetan but it’s the only one around) on the right. Follow the alley up to the right, and make your way to the ridge, where you wind steeply uphill to a collection of prayer flags and the ruins of a <span class="anchor" id="ref-21e1610ff20d8d5d747795d7a79ed681"/><span class="name">hermitage</span> <span class="practicalities">(</span><span class="map-links">

<p class="body-text">You can cycle to Sāngkē from Xiàhé in about one hour. A taxi costs ¥50 return, or ¥250 for an English-speaking guide and driver; enquire at <a href="ebook-39-gansu-chi15.xhtml#ref-4b8d0846900fdaa5a07d8bcd8ef8dc6b">Snowy Mountain Cafe</a>.

For all-day or overnight treks, including to <strong>Huágàishén Shān</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">华盖神山; </span></span>4200m), all the horse-trekking companies and most of the hostels in town can arrange a local guide.</p>
<p class="body-text">Southwest of Kerti Gompa is <strong>Namo Gorge</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">纳摩峡谷; </span></span>Nàmó Xiágǔ), which makes for an excellent two- to three-hour (return) hike. The gorge contains several sacred grottoes, one dedicated to the Tibetan goddess Palden Lhamo, the other a stone-tablet-labelled <strong>Fairy Cave</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">仙女洞; </span></span>Xiānnǚ Dòng), where monks sometimes chant inside, which gives the town its Tibetan name (<em>lángmù</em> means 'fairy'). Cross rickety bridges flung over the gushing stream, trek past piles of <em>mani</em> stones and prayer flags, and hike on into a splendid ravine. After about 30 minutes of clambering over rocks you reach a grassy plain surrounded by towering peaks.</p>
<p class="body-text">A popular trek is the hike along the White Dragon River to the <strong>river’s source</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">白龙江源头; </span></span>Báilóng Jiāng Yuántóu), where domestic hikers go in search of <em>chóngcǎo</em> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">虫草</span></span>), a coveted herb used in Chinese medicine.</p>
<p class="body-text">Another lovely walk heads out over the hills along a narrow paved road from the stupa at Serti Gompa (you must pay admission to pass through) to the small village of <strong>Jíkēhé Cūn</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">吉科合村</span></span>). This hike can be combined with the hike to the White Dragon River source. When you reach the village, simply follow the loop and then head down a dirt path towards the valley below.

Two sets of stairs also lead to the dam floor, allowing worshippers to descend and light incense.</p>
<p class="body-text">Transportation to Tiāntīshān is irregular. The best way to get here is to hire a private driver or taxi in Wǔwēi (¥200, half-day). Some through buses go from Wǔwēi bus station; you'll have to ask for the Tiāntīshān minibus (¥12, 3½ hours, every 30 minutes). You'll be dropped off along the main highway, from where it's a 20-minute walk to the grottoes; however, the return journey can be very problematic, with no regular buses or services from the grottoes themselves.</p>

<p class="flush-left">Smack-dab in the middle of the Héxī Corridor, the chilled-out city of Zhāngyè (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">张掖</span></span>) has a relaxed atmosphere that belies its historical status as an outpost connecting Central Asia to the Chinese empire via the Silk Road. Marco Polo is said to have spent a year here around 1274 – he provided a detailed description of Zhāngyè (by its historical name, Campichu) in <em>The Travels of Marco Polo</em>. Even the name Zhāngyè alludes to its Silk Road importance: <span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">张掖 </span></span>is a shortening of '<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">张国臂掖，以通西域</span></span>', which translates as 'Extending the arm of the nation to its Western Realm'.</p>
<p class="body-text">Today, Zhāngyè is a useful base from which to explore the otherwordly landscapes of the Dānxiá Geopark and the ancient cliff temples at Mǎtí Sì. In town, one of Asia's largest reclining Buddhas is ensconced in a beautifully preserved wooden temple, which, according to legend, was the birthplace of Mongol warrior Kublai Khan.</p>

The caves are reached via twisting staircases, balconies, narrow passages and platforms that will leave your head spinning.</p>

<p class="flush-left">One of the classic images of western China, this fort once guarded the narrow pass between the snowcapped Qílián Shān peaks and the Hēi Shān (Black Mountains) of the Mǎzōng Shān range.</p>
<p class="body-text">Built in 1372, it was named the ‘Impregnable Defile Under Heaven’. Although the Han Chinese often controlled territory far beyond here, this was the last major stronghold of imperial China – the end of their ‘civilised world’, beyond which lay only desert demons and the barbarian armies of Central Asia.</p>
<p class="body-text">Towards the eastern end of the fort is the <strong>Gate of Enlightenment</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">光化楼; </span></span>Guānghuá Lóu) and on the west side is the <strong>Gate of Conciliation</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">柔远楼; </span></span>Róuyuǎn Lóu), from where exiled poets, ministers, criminals and soldiers would have ridden off into oblivion. Each gate dates from 1506 and has 17m-high towers with upturned flying eaves and double gates that would have been used to trap invading armies. On the inside are horse lanes leading up to the top of the inner ramparts.</p>
<p class="body-text">The fort received major refurbishments in 2015, brightening up wood with coats of paint and reinforcing foundations and cracked walls.</p>
<p class="body-text">Near the fort entrance gate is the excellent <a href="ebook-39-gansu-chi15.xhtml#ref-a323921890d38fbf43078ae2341f8317">Jiāyùguān Museum of the Great Wall</a>, which has some interesting exhibits about the Wall and its history in this part of China.</p>

<p class="box-flush-left">The road from Jiāyùguān to Dūnhuáng is impressive as much for the stark desert landscape as the endless spinning turbines. Once the cradle of China’s oil industry, this windswept northern region has become the site of nearly two dozen energy farms and 5000 (and growing) individual turbines. At the industry centre in Jiǔquán (southeast of Jiāyùguān) dozens of companies are cranking out several thousand more each year.</p>
<p class="box-body-text">The pace of change has been breathtaking. From 2006 to 2010, the wind industry experienced triple-digit growth, and construction began on 10GW wind farms (1GW is the capacity of a large coal or nuclear power plant) in Gānsù, Xīnjiāng, Inner Mongolia, Jílín and Héběi. China also became the world's largest maker of turbines in 2010.</p>
<p class="box-body-text">Rapid progress has brought hiccups. Installed capacity has far outpaced the rate at which it can be absorbed by the national electric grid. And while China became the world's largest wind-farm market by 2013, it also overtook the US as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="box-body-text">Yet the blades won't stop churning. The green light was given in 2014 to construct wind farms in Jiāngsū with a whopping 300GW total capacity. Long-term projections have wind potentially accounting for up to one-third of all capacity by 2050. With an equally strong push into solar, hydro and nuclear, China’s electrical production could one day become among the cleanest in the world.</p>

<p class="flush-left">The fertile Dūnhuáng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">敦煌</span></span>) oasis has for millennia been a refuge for weary Silk Road travellers. Most visitors stayed long enough only to swap a camel; but some stayed, building the forts, towers and cave temples that are scattered over the surrounding area. These sites, along with some dwarfing sand dunes and desertscapes, make Dūnhuáng a magnificent place to visit.</p>
<p class="body-text">Despite its remoteness, Dūnhuáng's per capita income is among the highest in China, thanks to a push into wind and solar energy production. The town is thoroughly modern, but has maintained its distinctive desert-sanctuary ambience – with clean, tree-lined streets, slow-moving traffic, bustling markets, budget hotels, cafes and souvenir shops.</p>
<p class="body-text">Though relatively small, it's a great walking town with wide footpaths and narrow alleys opening up into squares, markets and the lives of ordinary citizens. The riverside is worth a visit if only to see if you are brave enough to cross to the platforms in the middle of the stream.</p>

 <h3>SILK ROAD RAIDERS</h3>
<p class="box-flush-left">In 1900, the self-appointed guardian of the <a href="ebook-39-gansu-chi15.xhtml#ref-a48fe695a262b0e5342ec0d98b5c3a74">Mògāo Grottoes</a>, Wang Yuanlu, discovered a hidden library filled with tens of thousands of immaculately preserved manuscripts and paintings, dating as far back as AD 406.</p>
<p class="box-body-text">It’s hard to describe the exact magnitude of the discovery, but stuffed into the tiny cave were texts in rare Central Asian languages, military reports, music scores, medical prescriptions, Confucian and Taoist classics, and Buddhist sutras copied by some of the greatest names in Chinese calligraphy – not to mention the oldest printed book in existence, the <em>Diamond Sutra</em> (AD 868). In short, it was an incalculable amount of original source material regarding Chinese, Central Asian and Buddhist history.</p>
<p class="box-body-text">Word of the discovery quickly spread and Wang Yuanlu, suddenly the most popular bloke in town, was courted by rival archaeologists Aurel Stein and Paul Pelliot, among others. Following much pressure to sell the cache, Wang Yuanlu finally relented and parted with an enormous hoard of treasure. On his watch close to 20,000 of the cave’s priceless manuscripts were whisked off to Europe for the paltry sum of £220.</p>
<p class="box-body-text">Today, Chinese intellectuals bitter at the sacking of the caves deride Stein, Pelliot and others for making off with what they consider to be national treasures. Defenders of the explorers point out that had the items been left alone, there is a chance they could have been lost during the ensuing civil war or the Cultural Revolution.</p>

<p class="flush-left">The Mògāo Grottoes are considered one of the most important collections of Buddhist art in the world. At its peak during the Tang dynasty (618–907), the site housed 18 monasteries, more than 1400 monks and nuns, and countless artists, translators and calligraphers.</p>
<p class="body-text"><strong>Tours</strong> by excellent English-speaking guides at 9am, noon and 2.30pm are included in the admission price, and you should be able to arrange tours in other languages as well. Many of the guides are students or researchers at the Dūnhuáng Academy, which administers the caves.</p>
<p class="body-text">In 2015 the Mògāo Grottoes site saw a huge upgrade, with a state-of-the-art visitor centre built just a few kilometres outside of central Dūnhuáng. Admission includes two 30-minute films, one on the history of the area and the Silk Road, and one that allows close-up computer-generated views of cave interiors not normally open to visitors in an IMAX-style theatre. From here, visitors are shuttled to the caves 15km down the road in dedicated coaches.</p>
<p class="body-text">Of the 492 caves, 20 ‘open’ caves are rotated fairly regularly. Entrance is strictly controlled – it’s impossible to visit them independently. In addition to the two films, the general admission ticket includes a roughly two-hour tour of 10 caves, including the famous <strong>Hidden Library Cave</strong> (cave 17), the two <strong>big Buddhas</strong>, 34.5m and 26m tall, and a related exhibit containing rare fragments of manuscripts in classical Uighur and Manichean.</p>
<p class="body-text">Photography is prohibited inside the caves. If it’s raining or snowing or there's a sand storm, the site will be closed.</p>
<p class="body-text">Tickets must be purchased in advance either online at the caves' official website (Chinese ID card needed at the time of writing) or from the <a href="ebook-39-gansu-chi15.xhtml#ref-a1dfad074b69094f07808833a55557f4">Mògāo Grottoes Reservation and Ticket Center</a>, a separate booking office where staff speak English. Note that tickets are not sold at the main visitor centre.</p>
<p class="body-text">
 <strong class="poi-subheading">History</strong>
 </p>
<p class="body-text">Wealthy traders and important officials were the primary donors responsible for creating new caves, as caravans made the long detour past Mògāo to pray or give thanks for a safe journey through the treacherous wastelands to the west. The traditional date ascribed to the founding of the first cave is AD 366.</p>
<p class="body-text">The caves fell into disuse for about 500 years after the collapse of the Yuan dynasty and were largely forgotten until the early 20th century, when they were ‘rediscovered’ by a string of foreign explorers.</p>
<p class="body-text">
 <strong class="poi-subheading">Northern Wei, Western Wei &amp; Northern Zhou Caves</strong>
 </p>
<p class="body-text">These, the earliest of the Mògāo Caves, are distinctly Indian in style and iconography. All contain a central pillar, representing a stupa (symbolically containing the ashes of the Buddha), which the devout would circle in prayer. Paint was derived from malachite (green), cinnabar (red) and lapis lazuli (blue), expensive minerals imported from Central Asia.</p>
<p class="body-text">The art of this period is characterised by its attempt to depict the spirituality of those who had transcended the material world through their asceticism. The Wei statues are slim, ethereal figures with finely chiselled features and comparatively large heads. The northern Zhou figures have ghostly white eyes.</p>
<p class="body-text">
 <strong class="poi-subheading">Sui Caves</strong>
 </p>
<p class="body-text">The Sui dynasty (AD 581–618) was short-lived and very much a transition between the Wei and Tang periods. This can be seen in the Sui caves at Mògāo: the graceful Indian curves in the Buddha and Bodhisattva figures start to give way to the more rigid style of Chinese sculpture.</p>
<p class="body-text">The Sui dynasty began when a general of Chinese or mixed Chinese–Tuoba origin usurped the throne of the northern Zhou dynasty and reunited northern and southern China for the first time in 360 years.</p>
<p class="body-text">
 <strong class="poi-subheading">Tang Caves</strong>
 </p>
<p class="body-text">The Tang dynasty (AD 618–907) was Mògāo’s high point. Painting and sculpture techniques became much more refined, and some important aesthetic developments, notably the sex change (from male to female) of Guanyin and the flying apsaras (Buddhist celestial beings), took place. The beautiful murals depicting the Buddhist Western Paradise offer rare insights into the court life, music, dress and architecture of Tang China.</p>
<p class="body-text">Some 230 caves were carved during the religiously diverse Tang dynasty, including two impressive grottoes containing enormous, seated Buddha figures. Originally open to the elements, the statue of Maitreya in cave 96 (believed to represent Empress Wu Zetian, who used Buddhism to consolidate her power) is a towering 34.5m tall, making it the world’s third-largest Buddha. The Buddhas were carved from the top down using scaffolding, the anchor holes of which are still visible.</p>
<p class="body-text">
 <strong class="poi-subheading">Post-Tang Caves</strong>

<p class="body-text">Following the Tang dynasty, the economy around Dūnhuáng went into decline, and the luxury and vigour typical of Tang painting began to be replaced by simpler drawing techniques and flatter figures. The mysterious Western Xia kingdom, which controlled most of Gānsù from 983 to 1227, made a number of additions to the caves at Mògāo and began to introduce Tibetan influences.</p>

<p class="body-text">The Mògāo Grottoes are 25km (30 minutes) southeast of Dūnhuáng, but tours start and end at the visitor centre, about 5km from Mingshan Lu near the train station. A green minibus (one way ¥3) leaves for the visitor centre every 30 minutes from 8am to 5pm from outside the Silk Road Hotel (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">丝路宾馆; </span></span>Sīlù Bīnguǎn). A taxi costs ¥15 one-way, and taxis generally wait outside the visitor centre, so it's easy to find one on the way back.</p>

<p class="flush-left">Six kilometres south of Dūnhuáng at Singing Sands Dune, the desert meets the oasis in most spectacular fashion. From the sheer scale of the dunes, it’s easy to see how Dūnhuáng gained its moniker ‘Shāzhōu’ (Town of Sand). The view across the undulating desert and green poplar trees below is awesome.</p>
<p class="body-text">You can bike to the dunes in 20 minutes from the centre of Dūnhuáng. Bus 3 (¥2) shuttles between Shazhou Lu and Mingshan Lu and the dunes from 7.30am to 9pm. A taxi costs ¥20 one way.</p>
<p class="body-text">The climb to the top of the dunes – the highest peak swells to 1715m – is sweaty work, but worth it. Rent a pair of bright-orange shoe protectors (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">防沙靴; </span></span><em>fángshāxuē;</em> ¥15) or just shake your shoes out later.</p>
<p class="body-text">At the base of the colossal dunes is a famous pond, <strong>Crescent Moon Lake</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">月牙泉; </span></span>Yuèyáquán). The dunes are a no-holds-barred tourist playpen, with dune buggies, ‘dune surfing’ (sand sledding), paragliding and even microlighting. But it’s not hard to hike away to enjoy the sandy spectacle in peace.</p>
<p class="body-text">Tickets are good for three days' entry. To avail of this, you must ask the security staff at the gate as you exit – they will take your fingerprint so only you can use the ticket again.</p>
<p class="body-text">Hostels in Dūnhuáng offer overnight camel treks to the dunes from ¥400 per person. There are also five- to eight-day expeditions out to the <a href="ebook-39-gansu-chi15.xhtml#ref-047c95f1e716b810f006d038174116ca">Jade Gate Pass</a>, Liǔyuán and even as far as Lop Nor in the deserts of Xīnjiāng.</p>

<p class="body-text">For caravans travelling westward, the Jade Gate marked the beginning of the northern route to Turpan and was one of the last outposts that travellers and banished criminals saw before leaving the Chinese empire.

<p class="flush-left">Set among wild, green mountains southeast of Tiānshuǐ, the grottoes of Màijī Shān hold some of the most famous Buddhist rock carvings along the Silk Road. The cliff sides of Màijī Shān are covered with 221 caves holding more than 7800 sculptures carved principally during the Northern Wei and Zhou dynasties (AD 386–581). The rock face rises in a steep ascent, with the hundreds of grottoes connected by a series of constructed walkways clinging to the sheer cliff.</p>
<p class="body-text">Within the hard-to-miss Sui dynasty trinity of Buddha and two Bodhisattvas is the largest statue on the mountain: the cave’s central effigy of Buddha tops out at 15.7m. During restoration works on the statue in the late 1980s, a handwritten copy of the Sutra of Golden Light was discovered within the Buddha’s fan.</p>
<p class="body-text">Vertigo-inducing catwalks and steep spiral stairways cling to the cliff face, affording close-ups of the art. It’s not certain just how the artists managed to clamber so high; one theory is that they created piles from blocks of wood reaching to the top of the mountain before moving down, gradually removing them as they descended.</p>
<p class="body-text">A considerable amount of pigment still clings to many of the statues – a lot of which are actually made of clay rather than being hewn from rock – although you frequently have to climb up steps to peer at them through tight mesh grills with little natural illumination. Much, though, is clearly visible and most of the more impressive sculptures decorate the upper walkways, especially at cave 4.</p>
<p class="body-text">At the time of writing, a new visitors centre was being constructed at the base of the mountain to replace the crescent of noodle stalls that previously served as the only refreshments on the mountain.</p>
<p class="body-text">An English-speaking guide charges ¥50 for up to a group of five. It may be possible to view normally closed caves (such as cave 133) for an extra fee of ¥500 per group.</p>
<p class="body-text">The admission ticket includes entry to <strong>Ruìyìng Monastery</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">瑞应寺; </span></span><em>Ruìyìng Sì</em>), at the base of the mountain, which acts as a small museum of selected statues. Across from the monastery is the start of a trail to a <strong>botanic garden</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">植物园; </span></span><em>zhíwùyuán</em>), which allows for a short cut back to the entrance gate through the forest. If you don't want to walk the 2km up the road from the ticket office to the cliff, ask for tickets for the <strong>sightseeing trolley</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">观光车; </span></span><em>guānguāng chē;</em> ¥15) when buying your entrance ticket.</p>
<p class="body-text">You can also climb <strong>Xiāngjí Shān</strong> (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">香积山</span></span>). For the trailhead, head back towards the visitor centre where the sightseeing bus drops you off and look for a sign down a side road to the left.</p>
<p class="body-text">To reach Màijī Shān, take bus 34 (¥5 one way, one hour, every 15 minutes) from the bus shelter across from Tiānshuǐ Railway Station. It terminates at the Màijī Shān ticketing office.</p>

<p class="flush-left">A booming, midsized Chinese city, Píngliáng (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">平凉</span></span>) is a logical base for visits to the nearby holy mountain of Kōngtóng Shān, which, according to Taoist legend, is where the Yellow Emperor came to meet the avatar Guangchengzi.</p>

<p class="flush-left">Kōngtóng Shān, 11km west of Píngliáng, is one of the 12 principal peaks in the Taoist universe. It was first mentioned by the philosopher Zhuangzi (399–295 BC), and illustrious visitors have included none other than the Yellow Emperor. Numerous paths lead over the hilltop past dozens of picturesque (though entirely restored) temples to the summit at over 2100m. While the mountain is an enchanting place to hike, those looking for genuine historical artefacts or ambience will be disappointed.</p>
<p class="body-text">From the north gate visitor centre (pick up a free map here to orient yourself) catch a bus to Zhōngtái (¥32) or Xiāngshān (¥48); both are essentially small visitor areas on the mountain with paths radiating out to lookouts and temples.</p>
<p class="body-text">A taxi from Píngliáng will cost ¥30, or you can catch bus 16 (¥1) on Xi Dajie and then transfer to bus 13 (¥2) when you reach Kongtong Dadao. Bus 13 drops you off right in front of the main visitor centre before continuing on to the East Gate. At the end of your visit you can walk down from Zhōngtái to the East Gate and catch bus 13 back to town.</p>

<p class="body-text">Accommodation in Píngliáng is limited to just-fine Chinese-style hotels.</p>
<p class="body-text">Just off the main street (Xi Dajie), look for the Sìzhōng Alley market (<span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">四中巷市场</span></span><em>;</em> Sìzhōng Xiàng Shìchǎng). There are numerous restaurants here, and more food stalls serving noodles, spicy hotpot and barbecued meats, as well as fresh fruit.</p>
