        <h3>Why Go?</h3>
        
          <p class="flush-left">For many people, the highlights of Tibet will be of a spiritual nature: magnificent monasteries, prayer halls of chanting monks, and remote cliffside retreats. Tibet’s pilgrims – from local grandmothers murmuring mantras in temples heavy with the aroma of juniper incense and yak butter to hard-core visitors walking or prostrating themselves around Mt Kailash – are an essential part of this appeal. Tibet has a level of devotion and faith that seems to belong to an earlier, almost medieval age. It's fascinating, inspiring and endlessly photogenic.</p>
        
        
          <p class="body-text">Tibet's other big draw is the elemental beauty of the highest plateau on earth. Geography here is on a humbling scale and every view is lit with spectacular mountain light. Your trip will take you past glittering turquoise lakes, across huge plains dotted with yaks and nomads’ tents, and over high passes draped with colourful prayer flags. Hike past the ruins of remote hermitages, stare open-mouthed at the north face of Everest or make an epic overland trip along some of the world’s wildest roads. The scope for adventure is limited only by your ability to get permits.</p>

    <div class="history">
      <h3>History</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Recorded Tibetan history began in the 7th century AD, when the Tibetan armies began to assemble a great empire. Under King Songtsen Gampo, the Tibetans occupied Nepal and collected tribute from parts of Yúnnán. Shortly afterwards, the Tibetan armies moved north and took control of the Silk Road and the great trade centre of Kashgar, even sacking the imperial Chinese city of Cháng’ān (present-day Xī’ān).</p>
        <p class="body-text">Tibetan expansion came to an abrupt halt in 842 with the assassination of anti-Buddhist King Langdarma; the region subsequently broke into independent feuding principalities. The increasing influence of Buddhism ensured that the Tibetan armies would never again leave their high plateau.</p>
        <p class="body-text">By the 7th century, Buddhism had spread through Tibet, though it had taken on a unique form, as it adopted many of the rituals of Bön (the indigenous pre-Buddhist belief system of Tibet). The prayer flags, pilgrimage circuits and sacred landscapes you’ll see across modern Tibet all have their roots in the animist religion of Bön.</p>
        <p class="body-text">From the 13th century, power politics began to play an increasing role in religion. In 1641 the Gelugpa (‘Yellow Hat’ order) used the support of Mongol troops to crush the Sakyapa, their rivals. It was also during this time of partisan struggle that the Gelugpa leader adopted the title of Dalai Lama (Ocean of Wisdom), given to him by the Mongols. From here on out, religion and politics in Tibet became inextricably entwined and both were presided over by the Dalai Lama.</p>
        <p class="body-text">With the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, Tibet entered a period of de facto independence that was to last until 1950. In this year a resurgent communist China invaded Tibet, claiming it was ‘liberating’ more than one million Tibetans from feudal serfdom and bringing it back into the fold of the motherland.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Increasing popular unrest in response to Chinese land reform resulted in a full-blown revolt in 1959, which was crushed by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Amid popular rumours of a Chinese plot to kidnap him, the Dalai Lama fled to India. He was followed by an exodus of 80,000 of Tibet’s best and brightest, who now represent the Tibetan government-in-exile from Dharamsala, India.</p>
        <p class="body-text">The Dalai Lama, who has referred to China’s policies on migration as ‘cultural genocide’, is resigned to pushing for autonomy rather than independence, though even that concession has borne little fruit. The Chinese, for their part, seem to be waiting for him to die, positioning themselves to control the future politics of reincarnation. The Dalai Lama’s tireless insistence on a non-violent solution to the Tibet problem led to him winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, but despite global sympathy for the Tibetan cause, few nations are willing to raise the issue and place new business deals with China’s rising economic superpower at risk.</p>
        <p class="body-text">The Chinese are truly baffled by what they perceive as the continuing ingratitude of the Tibetans. They claim that Tibet pre-1950 was a place of abject poverty and feudal exploitation. China, they say, has brought roads, schools, hospitals, airports, factories and rising incomes.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Many Tibetans, however, cannot forgive the destruction in the 1950s and 1960s of hundreds of monasteries and shrines, the restrictions on religious expression, the continued heavy military presence, economic exploitation and their obvious second-class status within their own land. Riots and protests in the spring of 2008 brought this simmering dissatisfaction out into the open, as Lhasa erupted into full-scale riots and protests spread to other Tibetan areas in Gānsù, Sìchuān and Qīnghǎi provinces. The Chinese response was predictable: arrest, imprisonment and an increased police presence in many monasteries. The increasing desperation felt by many Tibetans has led to a spate of self-immolations by Tibetans across the region, including two in Lhasa’s Barkhor Circuit in 2012.</p>
        <p class="body-text">As immigration and breakneck modernisation continue, the government is gambling that economic advances will diffuse the Tibetans’ religious and political aspirations. It’s a policy that has so far been successful in the rest of China. Whether it will work in Tibet remains to be seen.</p>

      <h3>Climate </h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Most of Tibet is a high-altitude desert plateau at more than 4000m. Days in summer (June to September) are warm, sunny and generally dry, but temperatures drop quickly after dark. It’s always cool above 4000m and often freezing at night, though thanks to the Himalayan rain shadow there is surprisingly little snow in the Land of Snows. Sunlight is very strong at these altitudes, so bring plenty of high-factor sunscreen and lip balm.</p>
      
    </div>
    <div class="history">
      <h3>Language</h3>
      
        <p class="flush-left">Most urban Tibetans speak Mandarin in addition to Tibetan. Even in the countryside you can get by with basic Mandarin in most restaurants and hotels, since they are normally run by Mandarin-speaking Han or Hui Chinese. That said, Tibetans are extremely pleased when foreign visitors at least greet them in Tibetan, so it’s well worth learning a few phrases.</p>

    <div class="info">
      <p class="info-heading-1 getting-there-away"><samp class="font-icon">8</samp>Getting There &amp; Away</p>
      
        <p class="info-flush-left">For most international travellers, getting to Tibet will involve at least two legs: first to a gateway city such as Kathmandu (Nepal) or Chéngdū (China) and then into Tibet.</p>
        <p class="info-body-text">The most popular options from the gateway towns into Tibet are as follows: flights from Kathmandu, Chéngdū, Kūnmíng, Xī’ān or Běijīng; the train link from Qīnghǎi to Lhasa; or the overland drive from Kathmandu to Lhasa along the Friendship Hwy.</p>
        <p class="info-body-text">At the time of writing, bureaucratic obstacles to entering Tibet from China were many and involved signing up for a preplanned and prepaid tour. The situation from Nepal is even trickier because of ever-changing group-visa requirements. Political events, both domestic and international, can mean that regulations for entry into Tibet change overnight. Nerves of steel are definitely useful when arranging flights and permits. Always check on the latest developments before booking flights.</p>
        <p class="info-body-text">Note that it can be very hard to get hold of air and train tickets to Lhasa around the Chinese New Year and the week-long holidays around 1 May and 1 October.</p>
        <p class="info-body-text">Flights, hotels and tours can be booked online at <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/bookings.">www.lonelyplanet.com/bookings.</a></p>
      
      <div>
        <p class="info-heading-2">Air</p>
        
          <p class="info-flush-left">There are no direct long-haul flights to Tibet. You will probably have to stop over in Kathmandu, Chéngdū, Guǎngzhōu or Běijīng, even if you are making a beeline for Lhasa, especially considering you need to to pick up your permit in your chosen gateway city before heading to Lhasa.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="info-heading-2">Land</p>
        
          <p class="info-flush-left">Many individual travellers make their way to Tibet as part of a grand overland trip through China, Nepal, India and onwards. In many ways, land travel to Tibet is the best way to go, not only for the scenery en route but also because it can help spread the altitude gain over a few days.</p>
          <p class="info-body-text">All overland trips inside the Tibet Autonomous Region have to be organised tours with vehicle rental and a guide.</p>
        
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="info-heading-2">Train</p>
        
          <p class="info-flush-left">Trains to Lhasa leave from Běijīng, Chéngdū, Shànghǎi, Xīníng and Guǎngzhōu daily, and every other day from Chóngqìng (via Xī’ān) and Lánzhōu, to link with the Chéngdū and Xīníng trains, respectively. A twice-daily train service from Lhasa to Shigatse started in late 2014. Future extensions will include lines from Lhasa to Tsetang and the eastern region of Kongpo, to the Nepal border and from Golmud to Dūnhuáng in Gānsù province.</p>
          <p class="info-body-text">All current trains cross the Tibetan plateau during daylight, guaranteeing you great views. From Golmud, the train climbs through desert into the jagged caramel-coloured mountains of Nánshānkǒu (Southern Pass), passing what feels like a stone’s throw from the impressive glaciers beside Yùzhū Fēng (Jade Pearl Peak; 6178m). Other highlights include the tunnel through the 4776m Kunlun Pass, where you can see the prayer flags at the top of the pass, and Tsonak Lake (4608m), 9½ hours from Golmud near Amdo, claimed to be the highest freshwater lake in the world. Keep your eyes peeled throughout the journey for antelopes, foxes and wild asses, plus the occasional nomad. The train crosses into Tibet over the 5072m Tanggu-la (Tánggǔlā Shānkǒu) Pass, the line’s high point.</p>

        <p class="info-flush-left">Tibet’s transport infrastructure has developed rapidly in recent years. Most of the main highways are now paved. Airports are springing up on the plateau and the railway line is slowly extending beyond Lhasa. In 2011 Tibet’s Metok county was the very last of China’s 2100 counties to be connected by road.</p>

      <h3>TIBET TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS</h3>
      
        <p class="box-flush-left">The bottom line is that travel to the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) is radically different from travel to the rest of China; a valid Chinese visa is not enough to visit Tibet. You’ll also need several permits, foremost of which is a Tibet Tourism Bureau (TTB) permit, and to get these you have to book a tour. At a minimum you will need to hire a guide for your entire stay and transport for any travel outside Lhasa.</p>
      
      
        <p class="box-flush-left">Travel regulations to Tibet are constantly in flux, dependent largely on political events in Lhasa and Běijīng. Don’t be surprised if the permit system is radically different from how we describe it. In fact, expect it. One of the best places for updated information is the dedicated Tibet page of Lonely Planet’s Thorn Tree, at <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree.">www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree.</a></p>
        <p class="box-body-text">Other good sources of permit information are the websites <a href="http://www.thelandofsnows.com">www.thelandofsnows.com</a> and <a href="http://www.tibetpermit.org">www.tibetpermit.org</a>. The latter is run by an agency in Sìchuān but is generally reliable on permit matters.</p>
      
      
        <p class="box-flush-left">Start your tour planning two months in advance. Agencies need two to four weeks to arrange permits.</p>
        <p class="box-body-text">All of the rules have exceptions and by the time you have finished reading the below list of tips and fine print, many of them will probably have changed:</p>

          <p class="box-list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>TTB permits generally take three days to process and are not available during weekends. The actual permit is a sheet of paper listing the names and passport numbers of all group members.</p>
          <p class="box-list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>If you are planning to arrive in Lhasa on a flight or dates that differ from those of your travel companions, your agency may have to issue a separate TTB permit for the time you are by yourself. When you meet your friends you’ll then join the main permit. There doesn’t seem to be a problem getting on a flight with one or two group members not present.</p>
          <p class="box-list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>You will likely have to wire or transfer a deposit to your travel agency’s Bank of China account in Lhasa, though some agencies accept PayPal. You will pay the balance in cash in Lhasa. Check with the agency.</p>

        <h3>TIBET TOURISM BUREAU PERMIT</h3>
        
          <p class="box-flush-left">Without a Tibet Tourism Bureau (TTB) permit you will not be able to board a flight or train to Tibet or cross overland from Nepal and you will not be able to secure the other permits you need to continue travelling throughout Tibet.</p>
          <p class="box-body-text">How these rules are interpreted depends on the political climate in Tibet. These days you can only get a TTB permit through a tour agency in Tibet (agencies outside Tibet can arrange trips, but ultimately they book through a Tibetan-based agency). Everything must be arranged beforehand, including any trekking.</p>
          <p class="box-body-text">To get a permit you need to:</p>
          
            <p class="box-list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>work out an itinerary detailing exactly where you want to go in Tibet</p>
            <p class="box-list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>pay for a guide for every day of your tour, including arrival and departure days, at a rate of around ¥250 per day</p>
            <p class="box-list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>hire a vehicle for all transport outside Lhasa</p>
            <p class="box-list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>agree a price and send a deposit, normally through PayPal or a bank transfer (check the transfer charges)</p>
            <p class="box-list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>send a scan of your passport information pages and Chinese visa</p>
            <p class="box-list-b"><samp class="bullet_arrow">A</samp>arrange an address in China (usually that of a hotel, guesthouse or local agency) to receive your posted TTB permit, if flying to Lhasa.</p>
          
          <p class="box-body-text">What your tour actually involves depends on the agency. Some offer all-inclusive tours, while others will arrange transport, a guide and permits but leave accommodation, food and entry fees up to you. You can book your own train or air ticket to Lhasa or have the agency arrange this. Some airline offices and online booking agencies will sell flights to Lhasa to foreigners, but others won’t unless you can show you have a TTB permit. Some agencies require you to have a prebooked ticket out of Tibet, but most are happy for you to arrange this in Lhasa. Treks fall under the same permit requirements as normal tours.</p>
          <p class="box-body-text">You need to have the original permit in your hands in order to board a flight to Lhasa, so most agencies arrange to post the permit through an agency or hostel. This can cost anything from ¥25 for normal post (four working days) to ¥180/280/380 for 36-/24-/18-hour express post. A photocopy or scan of an original TTB permit is currently all that is required to board a train to Tibet, which saves on postage fees. The permit is actually free, though most agencies charge a few hundred yuan per person for the bureaucratic runaround.</p>
          <p class="box-body-text">Agencies can only apply for some permits 15 days before departure, so there is invariably a last-minute rush to get permits posted to you in time. Travel restrictions and closures occur without warning, as with the closure of Ngari (western Tibet) for several months in summer 2014 or the whole of Tibet for a week in June 2016. Note that official regulations change particularly quickly if there are any political disturbances. In 2012 temporary regulations were introduced requiring that groups have a minimum of five persons, all of the same nationality. A few months later Tibet was closed to foreigners completely for a short time, after two cases of self-immolation in Lhasa.</p>
          <p class="box-body-text">TTB permits are not issued in March due to the anniversary of several politically sensitive dates. Assuming the political situation is calm, permits normally start to be reissued in the last week of March and agencies only know the new season's permit regulations for sure by the end of March. The last-minute nature and uncertainty that comes with this obviously complicates booking train and flight tickets; we recommend booking a fully refundable ticket if possible and taking out trip-cancellation insurance in case your permits fail to materialise.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>ALIEN'S TRAVEL PERMITS &amp; MILITARY PERMITS</h3>
        
          <p class="box-flush-left">Once you have a visa and have managed to wangle a TTB permit, you might think you're home and dry. Think again. Your agency will need to arrange an alien's travel permit for most of your travels outside Lhasa.</p>
          <p class="box-body-text">Travel permits are <em>not</em> needed for Lhasa or places just outside the city such as Ganden Monastery, but most other areas do technically require permits. Permits are most easily arranged in the regional capital, so for Ngari (western Tibet) you’ll have to budget an hour in Shigatse, and possibly also Ali or Darchen, for your guide to process the permit. Agencies can only arrange a travel permit for those on a tour with them.</p>
          <p class="box-body-text">Sensitive border areas – such as Mt Kailash, the road to Kashgar and the Nyingtri region of eastern Tibet – also require a military permit and a foreign-affairs permit. For remote places such as the Yarlung Tsangpo gorges in southeastern Tibet, the roads through Lhoka south of Gyantse or for any border area, you will likely not be able to get permits even if you book a tour. Regions can close at short notice. The entire Chamdo prefecture has been closed since 2010, effectively blocking overland trips from Sìchuān and Yúnnán. You’ll have to check to see if this has changed.</p>
          <p class="box-body-text">You should give your agency a week to 10 days to arrange your permits, and three weeks if military or other permits are required. The authorities generally won’t issue permits more than 15 days in advance. Local Public Security Bureau (PSB) officers often make the ultimate decision on whether you can visit a site, so you’ll need a certain flexibility if you're headed off the beaten track.</p>

          <p class="box-flush-left">In general, Tibetan tour agencies are not as professional as agencies in neighbouring Nepal or Bhutan. The following companies in Lhasa are experienced in arranging customised trips.</p>

        <h3>TOUR AGENCIES ELSEWHERE IN CHINA</h3>
        
          <p class="box-flush-left">There are several good companies outside the TAR that can arrange tours in Tibet. Many are based in the Tibetan areas of China and operate through local contacts in Lhasa. Depending on your itinerary it can be useful to arrange your tour through one of these outfits; if catching the train from Xīníng, for example, it’s handy to use an agency there to help arrange hard-to-find train tickets and permit pickup.</p>

Your first view of the red and white Potala Palace soaring above the Holy City raises goosebumps and the charming whitewashed old Tibetan quarter continues to preserve the essence of traditional Tibetan life. It is here in the Jokhang, an other-worldly mix of flickering butter lamps, wafting incense and prostrating pilgrims, and the encircling Barkhor pilgrim circuit, that most visitors first fall in love with Tibet.</p>
          <p class="body-text">These days the booming boulevards of the modern Chinese city threaten to overwhelm the winding alleyways and backstreet temples of the Tibetan old town, but it is in the latter that you should focus your time. If possible, budget a week to acclimatise, see the sights and roam the fascinating back streets before heading off on a grand overland adventure.</p>

              <p class="flush-left">The magnificent Potala Palace, once the seat of the Tibetan government and the winter residence of the Dalai Lamas, is Lhasa's cardinal landmark. Your first sight of its towering, fortress-like walls is a moment you'll remember for years. An architectural wonder even by modern standards, the palace rises 13 storeys from 130m-high Marpo Ri (Red Hill) and contains more than 1000 rooms. Pilgrims and tourists alike shuffle open-mouthed through the three storeys, past the dozens of magnificent chapels, golden stupas and prayer halls.</p>
            
            
              <p class="body-text">The first recorded use of the site was in the 7th century AD, when King Songtsen Gampo built a palace here. Construction of the present structure began during the reign of the fifth Dalai Lama in 1645 and took divisions of labourers and artisans more than 50 years to complete. It is impressive enough to have caused Chinese premier Zhou Enlai to send his own troops to protect it from the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.</p>
              <p class="body-text">The layout of the Potala Palace includes the rooftop <span class="anchor" id="ref-b240f7b7fe76ab48a5936119f1675e93"/><span class="name">White Palace</span> <span class="practicalities">(</span><span class="map-links">

The most stunning chapels of the Red Palace house the jewel-bedecked golden chörten (Tibetan stupa) tombs of several previous Dalai Lamas. The apartments of the 13th and 14th Dalai Lamas, in the White Palace, offer a more personal insight into palace life.</p>
              <p class="body-text">Tickets for the Potala are limited and your guide will need to book a time slot several days in advance. Arrive at the palace an hour or so before your allotted time. After a security check (no water or lighters allowed), follow the other visitors to the stairs up into the palace. Halfway up you'll pass the ticket booth, where you'll buy your ticket. Note that if you arrive later than the time on your voucher (or if you forget your voucher) you can be refused a ticket. Photography isn't allowed inside the chapels.</p>

              <p class="flush-left">The 1300-year-old Jokhang Temple is the spiritual heart of Tibet: the continuous waves of awestruck pilgrims prostrating themselves outside are a testament to its timeless allure. The central golden Buddha image here is the most revered in all of Tibet.</p>
            
            
              <p class="body-text">The Jokhang was originally built to house an image of Buddha brought to Tibet by King Songtsen Gampo's Nepalese wife. However, another image, the Jowa Sakyamuni, was later moved here by the king's other wife (the Chinese Princess Wencheng), and it is this image that gives the Jokhang both its name and its spiritual potency: Jokhang means 'chapel of the Jowo'.</p>
              <p class="body-text">The two-storeyed Jokhang is best visited in the morning, though the crowds of yak-butter-spooning pilgrims can be thick. Access is possible in the afternoon through a side entrance, but only the ground-floor chapels can be viewed (and then only through a grille) and there are no pilgrims.</p>

Choephel (1903–51) was a monk, poet, translator, scientist, travel writer, painter, linguist, medic, sexologist, scholar of Sanskrit and all-round nonconformist. The museum suffers from a dogmatic note in its commentary; you may find your eyes glazing over when text expounds on the 'caesaropapist feudal serf system'.

Throughout the day, pilgrims perform full-body prostrations in front of the images, while stone carvers at the far end of the courtyard contribute to a large chörten built entirely of the carvers’ mani stones.

The square has been a focus for violent political protest on several occasions, notably in 1998 (when a Dutch tourist was shot in the shoulder) and most recently in 2008. The square is now bordered by metal detectors, riot-squad vehicles, fire-extinguisher teams (to prevent self-immolations) and rooftop surveillance. Despite the stream of selfie-taking tourists, the atmosphere is one of occupation or siege.</p>

            <p class="info-body-text">To book a ticket you'll need to complete a form, get a reservation and then pay the cashier (cash only). Sample full fares include ¥1680 to Chéngdū, ¥3260 to Běijīng (only some flights are direct) and ¥1900 to Xīníng.</p>

              <p class="info-flush-left">At the time of research foreigners were not allowed to take bus services around Tibet and had to arrange their own transport. In case this changes, the following public transport operates.</p>
              <p class="info-body-text">Buses to popular pilgrim destinations leave early in the morning from the corner of Duosenge and Yuthok roads. Buses leave between 6:30am and 7:30am for Ganden Monastery (¥50), Tsurphu Monastery (¥60) and Drak Yerpa (¥30). Buses depart when full, so expect lots of hanging around.</p>
              <p class="info-body-text">At the time of research the main <span>Western Bus Station</span> wasn’t selling bus tickets to foreigners. In case this changes, there are hourly services to Shigatse, Tsetang and Nagchu (Nǎqū), plus a daily service to Gyantse and long-distance services to Chamdo, Markham, Zhōngdiān, Golmud and Xīníng. Private cars also run from here for about double the cheapest bus fare per seat.</p>
              <p class="info-body-text">The <span>Eastern Bus Station</span> has frequent minibuses to Lhundrub (Línzhōu) and Medro Gongkar (Mòzhú Gōngkǎ), from outside the main station, plus daily buses to Drigung Til and Reting Monastery.</p>
              <p class="info-body-text">Lhasa’s <span>Northern Bus Station</span> has sleeper buses to Ali (60 hours) in western Tibet, as well as buses to Zhangmu, Yadong, Markham, Zhōngdiān and Shigatse.</p>

There are daily trains to/from Běijīng, Xī’ān, Shànghǎi and Guǎngzhōu and four daily to/from Xī’níng or Lánzhōu, and every other day to/from Chéngdū and Chóngqìng. Most trains from Lhasa depart between 8am and 2pm, while all trains to Lhasa arrive in the evening. The train station is 4km southwest of town.</p>
            <p class="info-body-text">A new daily train service to Shigatse started in late 2014. Fares for the three-hour trip cost around ¥41 for a hard seat or ¥120/176 for a hard/soft sleeper. Train Z8801 departs Lhasa at 8.30am, returning from Shigatse at 6.40pm.Train Z8803 departs Lhasa at 3.20pm, returning from Shigatse at 12.05pm. If your tour agency can secure tickets you may be able to add Shigatse onto a Lhasa trip without having to fork out for pricey vehicle hire.</p>

        <h3>THE WORLD’S HIGHEST TRAIN RIDE</h3>
        <span class="anchor" id="ref-5bf729f18e542f0ae618b94860569a51"/>
          <p class="box-flush-left">There’s no doubt the Qīnghǎi–Tibet train line is an engineering marvel. Topping out at 5072m, it is the world’s highest railway, snatching the title from a Peruvian line. The statistics speak for themselves: 86% of the line is above 4000m, and half the track lies on permafrost, requiring a cooling system of pipes driven into the ground to keep it frozen year-round to avoid a rail-buckling summer thaw. Construction of the line involved building 160km of bridges and elevated track, seven tunnels (including the world’s highest) and 24 hyperbaric chambers, the latter to treat altitude-sick workers.</p>
          <p class="box-body-text">Aside from environmental concerns, Tibetans are deeply worried about the cultural and political impact of the train. The trains unload thousands of Chinese tourists and immigrants into Lhasa every day, and connecting China’s rail network to the only province in China lacking a rail link has forged Tibet and China together. A similar thing happened with the 1999 railway line to Kashgar in Xīnjiāng.</p>
          <p class="box-body-text">The authorities stress the economic benefits of the line: highly subsidised, it has decreased transport costs for imports by up to 75%. But Tibetans remain economically marginalised. More than 90% of the 100,000 workers employed to build the line came from other provinces and few, if any, Tibetan staff members work on the trains. The US$4.1 billion cost of building the line is greater than the amount Běijīng has spent on hospitals and schools in Tibet over the past 50 years.</p>
          <p class="box-body-text">As ambitious as the current line is, connecting Lhasa with the rest of China was only the beginning. An extension to Shigatse opened in 2014, and plans are in place to expand the network south to the Nepal border, and east to Tsetang, Nyingtri and Sìchuān province beyond.</p>

              <p class="flush-left">Along with Sera and Ganden Monasteries, Drepung functioned as one of the three 'pillars of the Tibetan state', and it was purportedly the largest monastery in the world, with around 7000 resident monks at its peak. Drepung means 'rice heap', a reference to the white buildings dotting the hillside. The 1½-hour kora (pilgrim circuit) around the 15th-century monastery, 8km west of Lhasa, is among the highlights of a trip to the city.</p>
            
            
              <p class="body-text">The kings of Tsang and the Mongols savaged the place regularly, though, oddly, the Red Guards pretty much left it alone during the Cultural Revolution. With concerted rebuilding, Drepung once again resembles a monastic village and around 600 monks reside here. At lunchtime you can see the novices bringing in buckets of tsampa (roasted-barley flour) and yak-butter tea. In the afternoons you can often see Tibetan-style religious debating (lots of hand slapping and gesticulating). The best way to visit the monastery is to follow the pilgrim groups or the yellow signs.</p>
              <p class="body-text">Nearby <strong>Nechung Monastery</strong>, a 10-minute walk downhill, was once the home of the Tibetan state oracle and is worth a visit for its blood-curdling murals.</p>
              <p class="body-text">Bus 25 (¥1) runs from Beijing Donglu to the foot of the Drepung hill, from where minivans (¥2) run up to the monastery. Most tourists take a taxi from the Barkhor area for around ¥40. There is a ¥10 to ¥20 charge per chapel for photography.</p>

If you only have time for one monastery excursion outside Lhasa, Ganden is the best choice. With its stupendous views of the surrounding Kyi-chu Valley and its fascinating kora (pilgrim circuit), Ganden makes for an experience unlike those at the other major Gelugpa monasteries in the Lhasa area.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Ganden means ‘joyous’ in Tibetan and is the name of the Western Paradise (also known as Tushita) that is home to Jampa, the Future Buddha. There is a certain irony in this because, of all the great monasteries of Tibet, Ganden suffered most at the hands of the Red Guards, possibly because of its political influence.</p>

There are superb views over the braided Kyi-chu Valley along the way and there are usually large numbers of pilgrims and monks offering prayers, rubbing holy rocks and prostrating themselves along the path. There are two parts to the walk: the high kora and the low kora. The high kora climbs Angkor Ri south of Ganden and then drops down the ridge to join up with the low kora.</p>

              <p class="flush-left">About 5km north of Lhasa, Sera was founded in 1419 by a disciple of Tsongkhapa as one of Lhasa's two great Gelugpa monasteries. About 600 monks are now in residence, down from an original population of around 5000. The half-dozen main colleges feature spectacular prayer halls and chapels. Equally interesting is the monk debating that takes place from 3pm to 5pm in a garden near the assembly hall. Don't miss the fine, hour-long kora (pilgrim circuit) around the exterior of the monastery.</p>

Due to its proximity to Lhasa, Ü is the first taste of rural Tibet that most visitors experience, and you can get off the beaten track surprisingly quickly here. Fine walking opportunities abound, from day hikes and monastery koras (pilgrim circuits) to overnight treks.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Ü is the traditional power centre of Tibet, and home to its oldest buildings and most historic monasteries. The big sights, such as Samye, are unmissable, but consider also heading to lesser-visited places such as the Drak and Ön Valleys, or to smaller monasteries like Dranang and Gongkar Chöde. Make it to these hidden gems and you’ll feel as though you have Tibet all to yourself.</p>

It’s only a couple of hours from Lhasa and the numerous attractions are relatively near one another, allowing you to see the main sights in two or three days. Remote monasteries, royal tombs, ruined stupas, meditation retreats and medieval palaces are only some of the highlights you can visit in a three-day itinerary. With more time you could spend days exploring the various side valleys on foot or by mountain bike.</p>

As you drive in across the plains, the site of the Potala-lookalike Shigatse Dzong, high on a hilltop overlooking the town, will probably fire your imagination, but the fort is empty and most of what you see dates from a 2007 reconstruction. It is the Tashilhunpo Monastery, to the west of town, that is the real draw. Since the Mongol sponsorship of the Gelugpa order, Shigatse has been the seat of the Panchen Lama, and this seat was traditionally based in the monastery.</p>

            <p class="flush-left">As the traditional capital of the central Tsang region, Shigatse was long a rival with Lhasa for political control of the country. The Tsang kings and later governors exercised their power from the imposing heights of the (recently rebuilt) Shigatse Dzong. Since the time of the Mongol sponsorship of the Gelugpa order, Shigatse has been the seat of the Panchen Lamas, the second-highest-ranking lamas in Tibet. Their centre was and remains the Tashilhunpo Monastery.</p>

The town is southeast of Shigatse, about 25km off the Southern Friendship Hwy, accessed via a paved road through a pretty farming valley. The draw is Sakya Monastery<strong>,</strong> which ranks as one of the most atmospheric, impressive and unique monasteries in Tibet. Moreover, Sakya occupies a pivotal place in Tibetan history.</p>
            <p class="body-text">In recent years Sakya village has transformed from a village into a town and the area around the monastery has been developed by a private company to include a huge parking lot and a hefty new entry fee, but Sakya still feels somewhat off the grid.</p>

The ticket costs ¥400 per vehicle plus ¥180 per passenger. Your guide (but not driver) will also need a ticket. Make sure you are clear with your agency about whether this cost is included in your trip (it usually isn’t).</p>
            <p class="info-body-text">Your passport and PSB permit will be scrutinised at the major checkpoint 6km west of Shegar, where you'll have to personally walk through the passport check.

            <p class="box-flush-left">The 1000km-or-so stretch of road between Kathmandu and Lhasa is without a doubt one of the most spectacular in the world. There are currently two routes from Kathmandu. The oldest route is via the border crossing at Kodari (1873m) and Zhāngmù (2250m), but this section was badly affected by Nepal's 2015 earthquake and remains closed to international traffic.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">The main Nepal–Tibet border crossing has shifted to Rasuwa at the meeting of Nepal's Langtang region and Tibet's Kyirong Valley. Chinese travellers have been using the border crossing for a few years now, but it was only opened to foreigners in 2016. It's a spectacular route that allows you to combine a trek in Nepal's Langtang region with a visit to lovely Peiku-tso on the Tibetan side. The section of road on the Tibetan side is paved, but the Nepali road is slow going, especially during the monsoon months from June to September.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">The closure of the border at Kodari means that Zhāngmù and Nyalam (3750m), where travellers used to spend their first night, are now virtual ghost towns. The two routes join just north of the La Lung-la (4845m) on the Friendship Hwy and continue to Tingri.</p>
            <p class="box-body-text">It is essential to watch out for the effects of altitude sickness during the early stages of this trip. If you intend to head up to Everest Base Camp (5150m), you really need to slip in a rest day at Tingri or Kyirong.</p>

            <p class="body-text">The age-old path around Mt Kailash is one of the world’s great pilgrimage routes and completely encircles Asia’s holiest mountain. With a 5630m pass to conquer, this kora is a test of both the mind and the spirit.</p>
            <p class="body-text">There’s some gorgeous mountain scenery along this trek, including close-ups of the majestic pyramidal Mt Kailash, but just as rewarding is the chance to see and meet your fellow pilgrims, many of whom have travelled hundreds of kilometres on foot to get here. Apart from local Tibetans, there are normally dozens of Hindus on the kora during the main pilgrim season (June to September). Most ride horses, with yak teams carrying their supplies. There are also plenty of Chinese tourists.</p>
            <p class="body-text">The route around Mt Kailash is a simple one: you start by crossing a plain, then head up a wide river valley, climb up and over the 5630m Drölma-la, head down another river valley, and finally cross the original plain to the starting point. It’s so straightforward and so perfect a natural circuit that it’s easy to see how it has been a pilgrim favourite for thousands of years.</p>
            <p class="body-text">The Mt Kailash trekking season runs from mid-May until mid-October, but trekkers should always be prepared for changeable weather. Snow may be encountered on the Drölma-la at any time of year and the temperature will often drop well below freezing at night. The pass tends to be snowed in from early November to early April.</p>
            <p class="body-text">The kora is becoming more and more popular. A tent and your own food are always a nice luxury, but there is now accommodation and simple food at Dira-puk and Zutul-puk. Guides can even book you a room here in advance. Bottled water, beer, instant noodles and tea are available every few hours at teahouse tents. Natural water sources abound, but you should bring the means of water purification. A dirt road now encircles two-thirds of the kora, but traffic is light and it's fairly easy to avoid.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Horses, yaks and porters are all available for hire in Darchen, the gateway town to the kora. Big groups often hire yaks to carry their supplies, but yaks will only travel in pairs or herds, so you have to hire at least two. Horses are an easier option but are surprisingly expensive because they are in great demand by Indian pilgrims. Most hikers carry their own gear or get by with the services of a local porter (¥210 per day for a minimum of three days). All guides and pack animals have to be arranged through a central <span class="name">office</span> <span class="practicalities">(</span><span class="practicalities"><span class="script japanese"><span class="script chinese simplified">岗仁波齐牛马运输服务中心; </span></span>Gǎngrén Bōqí Niúmǎ Yùnshū Fúwù Zhōngxīn</span> <img alt="icon-phonegif" class="prac-icon" src="images/icon-phone.gif"/><samp class="font-prac-icon">%</samp><span class="practicalities">porters 139 8907 5383, yaks &amp; horses 136 3897 3593</span><span class="practicalities">)</span> in Darchen.</p>

                <p class="flush-left">The festival of Saga Dawa marks the enlightenment of Sakyamuni, and occurs on the full-moon day of the fourth Tibetan month. In the Kailash region the highlight is the raising of the Tarboche prayer pole in the morning. Monks circumambulate the pole in elaborate costumes, with horns blowing. After the pole has been raised, about 1pm, everyone sets off on their kora.</p>

            <p class="flush-left">Most travellers spend a night in Darchen before the kora. Many guesthouses offer basic accommodation (no running water, outdoor pit toilets). Bigger places can be fully booked with large groups of Indian pilgrims during the summer months of June, July and August.</p>
          
          
            <p class="body-text">Supplies on the Mt Kailash kora are limited to instant noodles and beer, so stock up on snacks in Darchen's supermarkets before heading off.</p>

It's far from perfect – the wi-fi only really works in the lobby and you should check the plumbing before accepting a room – but the hot water is pretty reliable and rooms are spacious. It's next to the Himalaya Hotel.</p>

With its sapphire-blue waters, sandy shoreline and snowcapped-mountain backdrop, Manasarovar is immediately appealing, and a welcome change from the often forbidding terrain of Mt Kailash.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Most visitors base themselves at picturesque Chiu village, site of Chiu Monastery, on the northwestern shore of the lake. Indian pilgrims often drive around the lake, immersing themselves in the sacred waters at some point. You'll also see Tibetan pilgrims walking the four-day <span>kora path</span> around the lake.</p>
          
          
            <p class="body-text">The lake area has a one-time admission fee of ¥150 per person (the Mt Kailash fee does not cover this).</p>
